Post Pfizer Vaccine Experience,33,lam09i,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/lam09i/post_pfizer_vaccine_experience/,164,1612264324.0,"Hey guys,
I received the Pfizer Vaccine (only the first dose so far) and am looking for others to share experiences, mainly experience a week after the shot as well as related to physical activity and working out.
I did feel a little soreness in the shoulder the day after but felt overall alright. However it's been over a week now and I feel generally more tired at all times, especially at the gym. I am a hobby bodybuilder and am In the sport for 5 years now. Ever since I received the vaccine, I feel like my workouts have been short, way more exhausting and weaker. Has anyone else experienced this?",2021-02-02 13:12:04

Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine Obsevations,11,l96w0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/l96w0h/pfizerbiontech_vaccine_obsevations/,20,1612104893.0,"I (44/M) was inoculated around 6:45 in the evening on Wednesday, Jan. 27 with the Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine. I received the vaccine at a mass inoculation site at our local Expo Center. I am technically part of the 1b group, but was able to get the shot at the tail end of the 1a group, due to some wrangling by my employer.

I experienced some dizziness and splitting headache about 10 minutes after the injection (in right deltoid) and mild pain at injection site, while I was waiting in the 15 minute observation waiting area after the shot was given. On the 28th, I felt some nausea and dizziness again about 14 hours later and another bad headache. The nausea and dizziness dissipated shortly and the headache later in the afternoon. The injection site was slightly more painful. On Friday, 29th and Saturday, 30th, basically no symptoms. Counting my blessings.

Why I choose to get shot?

1) Health Concerns. I have some underlying conditions (Asthma, Hypertension and a few others).

2) Opportunity. I put my name in early with employer, got the call, drove to the site.

3) Research. If you read the trial data on the vaccine BNT162b2 it was 95% effective against COVID-19, 7 days after the 2nd dose: https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577?articleTools=true

What makes me apprehensive about this shot?

1) We do not know the long term side effects of the vaccine. Should I wait until this is determined?

2) Rabies, Influenza, Cytomegalovirus, and Zika have all had vaccines created with mRNA (all of which I have not had), yet the #1 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and #2 (modeRNA) vaccines use this new delivery system of mRNA for vaccination. Is mRNA truly safe for humans? 

3) The trial lasted 111 days (July 27 to Nov 14, 2020), so does that mean the vaccine was created in 4 months 17 days (139 days) minus the initial testing on humans, if you use the day of March 11 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this a pandemic? My memory tells me Dr. Anthony Fauci on many press conferences, said it would take a year to a year and a half to create a vaccine, yet Pfizer-BioNTech did it just under 5 months and also created a vaccine with a 95% efficacy. It almost seems to good to be true? 

4) LNP (Lipid Nanoparticles) is such a new technology in medicine, relatively speaking, it is also worrisome the effects this will have on our bodies with this vaccine?

5) Why is there such a heavy push to get vaccinated by the media and political affiliations? And why all of a sudden IS THIS vaccine free to anyone, but other vaccines are not? Who is paying for all of this?

6) If I wait until the summer when it is rolled out, will there still be enough available? Will there be a syringe shortage, as some are talking about? Will there be some other issue that arises, that I will not be able to get the shot, when the opportunity to get it is now?

Finally, some observations about the evening I received my shot:

1) There were some 40 booths set up, one after the other at my site, giving out the vaccines. It was not very private or HIPPA regulated, as one would normally see in a hospital setting and maybe this is because the government (ie. tax payer) is on the hook for the shots and privacy is not a concerned.

2) The nurse giving me the shot was (to my understanding) not a licensed nurse but a student nurse from the local university...not sure if this matters or not? My muscle of my arm had some spasms as it was being injected by her.

3) Before I got my shot, I had to wait a few minutes for it to be drawn up. The problem with this was, I had no idea what was injected in me, as I never saw the vial the “vaccine” was drawn out of. It was very much like the scene at the end of “The Wizard of Oz”, when the wizard came out from behind the curtain; a different nurse came from behind me through these make-shift booth curtains to hand the student nurse a syringe. I asked to see the syringe for any information on it, but all it had on it was a lot #. The nurse said to me, “this is your last chance to back out.” In conversation with her prior while I was waiting, she had told me she had yet to get the vaccine, but it was offered to her as part of the nursing program. She was still undecided to get hers.

4) As I was rushed to the booth, I was handed a 6 page document about the vaccine, that I did not really get to read until I got home later. Maybe it was my naivety about the vaccine, but I did not realize the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was not approved by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) but rather fell under an EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) by the FDA. Under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), the FDA Commissioner may allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by CBRN threat agents when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. READ EVERYTHING YOU ARE HANDED BEFORE YOU TAKE THE VACCINE, SO YOU CAN MAKE THE BEST INFORMED DECISION. I might have waited on getting it, had I known this little snippet about it, regardless of the claimed 95% efficacy.

I will update my post, if I experience any more symptoms. 

I am scheduled Feb. 17 for Dose #2. Am praying this was the right decision, despite my objections above.

Good Luck to those thinking about this difficult decision themselves and their families. It was not an easy one for me, even despite having already gotten the vaccine.",2021-01-31 16:54:53
Delayed Symptoms From 1st Dose 5 Days Later,15,l8skoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/l8skoz/delayed_symptoms_from_1st_dose_5_days_later/,18,1612061387.0,"I thought I would share my experience with the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine in case it's more common than I think. I had gotten it last week on Thursday (Jan 21st) and the only early-on symptom I had that I could confirm was from the vaccine was arm soreness at the injection site which was mostly just the day after and really not bad.

Fast forward to Tuesday, I started having really bad chills for a couple of hours while out eating with my Fiance, and checked my temperature when I got home and I was 99.1 (after drinking water so probably actually higher). My temperature stayed in that range for 2 days (Tues and Weds) along with the chills and I clocked it as high as 99.5 when intentionally avoiding water for 30+ minutes to get an accurate reading (yes, I hydrate a LOT). I also had bad chest pain, likely from muscle aches and tightness, and I was pretty convinced I had contacted COVID from my Fiance's coworker who tested positive a couple days prior.

My Fiance and I got tested and both came back negative so I can only assume this was a very delayed reaction to the vaccine, but I felt mostly better by Wednesday so all in all it just lasted about 2 days.",2021-01-31 04:49:47

Over the next hour (now!), I’ve developed chills, joint pain all over my upper body but especially in my left shoulder and arm, and mild headache. Just took some Advil PM and hoping to get some sleep. Will update in the morning.

Edit: chills suddenly stopped about an hour after they started last night and joint pain started subsiding. Feeling pretty normal this morning so far.

2nd edit: day after second vaccine knocked me on my ass! About an hour after I reported “feeling pretty normal” in the morning, I got chills again and my whole body was achy. I was lethargic, had achy joints and a mild headache. Slept a lot off and on most of the day and drank lots of water to stay hydrated. By about 8pm I was feeling much better.

weird side effect after second dose,7,l7d3ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/l7d3ao/weird_side_effect_after_second_dose/,4,1611907013.0,"this was just so crazy i had to share...

i got my second dose of the pfizer vaccine on tuesday, and for the most part felt fine the next day.  even the arm soreness was diminished from the first shot.  last night, however, approximately 30 hours after the shot, i decided to have a snack of chips and salsa.  these were left over from a meal the night before in which i had eaten a ton of both without any problem.  

only three dipped chips into my snack, my tongue started burning SEVERELY.  felt like my mouth was on fire.  i have a very high tolerance for spicy food and this was just some jalapeno based salsa that, as i mentioned, i had a lot of the night before and, if anything, was disappointed with how mild it was.  not so the next night.  my face turned red, my eyes were tearing, and no matter what i tried to do to ease the burn - bread, milk, ice cream - it lasted for nearly 30 minutes.  never experienced anything like that, and i eat habaneros, ghost peppers, etc, whenever i have the opportunity.

the only thing that could have done this is a reaction to the vaccine.  i did some research on capsaicin-induced mouth burn as a possible immune response and couldn't find anything but mentions of spicy food as being good for strengthening the immune system, but that's about it.  it was so weird.  i want to try it again tonight to see if the same thing will happen, but i honestly don't want to go through that again.

anyone heard of this or a physiological mechanism to explain it?  i had a bunch of co-workers who got the second dose today, so i have asked them to try tasting some salsa tomorrow in a mini experiment.  i'll report back if others notice the same effect or i am an isolated case...",2021-01-29 09:56:53

Second dose,15,kx253z,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/kx253z/second_dose/,17,1610644033.0,"*UPDATE - I survived. Last night was rough, but this morning I was fine (other than being exhausted from lack of sleep and a sore arm from the injection site). My supervisor had the opposite experience; she was fine all day yesterday but had to go home within two hours of being at work due to fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Our program director experienced these side effects after her first dose, but nothing after her second. My advice: try to schedule the shots on days when you are able to rest afterward and the following day; it seems like side effects vary but it would be safer to give yourself some time to recuperate :)

I just received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine this afternoon at 3:30pm. I felt fine immediately after, and figured I would have a pretty uneventful experience like I did the first time around (had no side effects except for a sore arm the next day). At around 7pm, I started to get a headache that got progressively worse. I laid down for a bit and fell asleep, only to wake up a few hours later with a headache, strong cramps similar to period cramps, and a low grade fever (99.1 temp). I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience so far, or if they had to miss work from side effects of the second dose?

The vaccine is paid for by the first COVID Relief Bill.  The Federal government is paying for it.  Why?  Because the Pandemic is crippling the economy and the vaccine is the only way out.

Why the rush?  Because 530k Americans have already died from it and we are losing thousands daily.  Until 80% of Americans are vaccinated, the Pandemic will continue to rage on.

A death from a heart attack can be listed as covid if covid is even present in the hospital.  This allows the hospital to get 20% more in reimbursements from Medicaid. If they even eyeball a ventilator, add $39,000 to the reimbursement. More people die from cigarettes and tobacco products than covid but hey, the tobacco lobby has the government in their back pockets. The government could make cigarettes illegal but they make too much money off tobacco.  Don’t think for a minute that the government or pharmaceutical companies care about how you die.

Comment,1,gpm3mif,,0,1614857017.0,"I’m about 6 days past my second dose. 

1st dose—a breeze! Just pain in the arm. 

2nd dose—Woke up with slight chills and body aches after receiving it the night before. As the day went on it got progressively worse. From about 11-630 I had really bad chills and body aches. It honestly felt like I had been in a car accident! It was very uncomfortable!! But as random as it came on, it also went away randomly! Around 630 I started feeling better. I slept about 9 hours that night and woke up the next day feeling fine! 

When I woke up I had barely any pain where I received the shot but I did have pain in my armpit for about 2 days! I checked and it said some people get pain there due to their lymph nodes!

Comment,1,gpdit92,,0,1614683492.0,"Got mine first dose yesterday, Feb 28. Will update as long as I have effects, and when I receive the second dose. 

For reference: I typically have a reaction to flu shots. In 2018, I ended up swelling, bruising, and getting a rash, whereas most years I only get minor swelling and ache, and maybe a slight immune response “like the flu”. To be fair, I typically also get colds around the same time, I tend to get sick the week in October the same week I schedule my vaccine. I have had some reactions (mostly the swelling) to medications/injections, so I was required to wait for 30 mins post injection. 

Day 1, immediately post dose: absolutely nothing, I barely even felt the needle. 

Day 1, up to 6 hours: if anything, just tired. I had a 2 hour ride to the site I went to, and 2 hours back. Both in the pouring rain, about 40°F. Didn’t eat til fairly late, and over ate at lunch. Could be many things. Ended up sleeping from 6pm until 9pm. 

Day 1, approx 8 hours post dose: arm started to get sore. This was about 10pm. Continued to get more sore overnight, ended up rolling onto arm while sleeping, which woke me up. 

Day 2: all day arm is pretty sore, sometimes for just pressure, sometimes it’s a constant sore. Guess depends on what I’m doing. Just spent approx. 2 hours meal prepping for the week, cutting veg and cooking, so it is a bit sore just from constant moving. It’s now 24 hours since soreness started (32 hours post dose) and I just took band aid off. No visible bruising/swelling etc.

Day 3: 48 hours later, soreness finally wore off. Small bruise, but no swelling. Let’s hope that’s the end of dose 1 side effects!",2021-03-02 13:11:32
Comment,1,gpddt13,,0,1614680805.0,"I received both doses as of 26th. The first dose was restricted to side effects of just pain at the injection site. I would rate it as moderate that lasted about 24 hours tops. Then all good. The second one had side effects very similar except far worse. My injection site was very sore that night (took my shot at 1:45PM). To the point that it kept me up late and I couldn't sleep on that side at all. I didn't take any pain meds just so I didn't reduce the efficacy. The next day the pain persisted, with redness and swelling and didn't reduce at all. I also had a small headache (less than moderate), just a small throb on and off. The following day, more of the same but with the shoulder pain reduced to moderate and below. Still a very small head throb every now and again. But now it is Mar 1st and I feel totally recovered. My shoulder feels the shot if I press against it but otherwise it is fine.

Comment,1,gpaqqql,,0,1614635207.0,"Contergean aka thalidomide was developed in 1956 and heavily marketed by the German pharmaceutical company that developed it. [Please see Chemie Grüehthal]. BioNtech is working in conjunction with Pfizer to produce several covid vaccines. Just because a drug isn’t produced by an American company doesn’t mean it won’t be made available to Americans under different names. (You ever heard of generic drugs?!) 

20,000 Americans, including pregnant women, were given thalidomide in “chemical trials” in the early 1960’s causing thousands of deaths and miscarriages along with babies born with malformed limbs. The pharmaceutical company that did this trial with thalidomide was an American company called Richardson-Merrill and Smith, Kline.  Sound familiar?  The side effects were not obvious immediately just as those aren’t for all these experimental covid vaccines.  When you volunteer to be in a clinical trial for a drug that is not proven safe or effective, you have no legal rights. 

Please be sure to read the fine print before you get a vaccine that has been FDA EUA for use only NOT for FDA APPROVAL and even FDA approval is suspect after President Obama signed legislation that pushes pharmaceutical drugs to market with less research requirements.

Well I know four people who died from covid and one long hauler, and no one who has died from the vaccine. But also, I do trust that the data being reported on adverse effects are correct, which I gather you don't.  If you don't believe the data we get from the medical establishment, then how exactly the fuck do we know about all the opoid deaths?  According to your logic, those should all just be covered up, too. If we can trust the medical establishment to report on adverse events from opiods, then we can trust them to report on adverse events from vaccines.

Comment,1,gp2uxsc,,0,1614488872.0,"Been experiencing similar symptoms to what I've been reading here, which makes me feel a bit better today since I'm not alone in this. A little background on me: I'm 38 (m) non smoker, extremely active run/workout 5/6 days a week, fairly healthy balanced diet, no known prexisting conditions. 

Got my first dose of Pfizer on Saturday (2/20). No immediate effects noticed. 

Day 1 - Sunday: Arm soreness, nothing else 

Day 2 - Monday: I feel fine, back to normal. Arm soreness gone. Was able to workout without a problem.

Day 3 - Tuesday: Tuesday evening began to develop a fever. Had chills and cold sweats. Fever went to 102 F.

Day 4 - Wednesday: Fever was up and down, started to develop a sore throat, minor congestion. At this point I was convinced that I caught Covid based on symptoms and went and got tested. Had very low energy and continued to sleep throughout most of the day. 

Day 5 - Thursday: No fever today, but still very lethargic and low energy. Sore throat persists. Results from Covid test came back negative. 

Day 6 - Friday: My body still feels run down. Attempted to workout. It was a struggle and felt like I was working out hungover. Also developed a headache which seemed to be concentrated behind my eyes. Low grade fever (99F) and still super tired. Sore throat isn't as bad as the day before.

Day 7 - Saturday: Slept 13 hours and headache still persists. Sore throat seems to be gone but I'm still low energy and running a low fever (99F). Have not moved from bed. 

I'm thankful to have the vaccine but coincidentally had a week off from work. I couldn't imagine going to work and being productive with these symptoms. If the second dose is allegedly worse, I do not look forward to it.

I always had problems with my sinuses, I would get sick every year but never had long term effects like covid did to me. So Mr. Square person who likes the supermarkets, yes vaccine isn't approved and yes it can kill but so do all other APPROVED vaccines can kill too. If the person knows he/she has had problems with vaccines before, or has many allergies well is better not to get vaccinated.

Comment,1,gotg8vk,,0,1614366795.0,"I’ve had both injections, my second on Monday (today is Friday for those reading this at a later date). I’m a teacher who has been in-person since August with underlying health conditions, so any complaints I have take a backseat to the protection it affords.

First injection: got it in the afternoon with no initial symptoms other than some fatigue later that evening. The next morning I woke up and felt like I had fallen on a doorknob with the shoulder that received the shot, which is an atypical reaction for me when receiving vaccinations. I did my usual activities, including some light tree pruning, cursing my arm because it hurt but it didn’t hinder my activities greatly. The next morning that pain was gone and I had no other symptoms.

Second injection: noticed swollen lymph nodes under the injection arm that are sensitive to the touch. I may be running a slight temperature or I may be overheating easier. I’ve had some mental health issues: increased anxiety and mood swings. My physiology is particularly sensitive to vaccines and medications in general (I don’t know why, my psychiatrist doesn’t know why—just lucky, I guess /s). It’s nothing I can’t recognize and deal with, since I’ve gotten used to living in this body with its many quirks. The random anxiety I have been experiencing is nothing compared to the panic I felt back in March when no one knew what the hell was going on.

During this time, VAERS received 934 reports of death* (0.0018%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports. A review of available clinical information including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records findings revealed no link with vaccination.

I could not even open my eyes forv2 days without throwing up. Cat scan. MRI, blood work all ok. 
Dr said could very well be vertigo brought on by vaccine even though no live virus in vaccine your body doesn't know that. There is a viral type of vertigo. 
Went for second vaccine since doc said better than getting covid. I actually had two days feeling better after 2nd shot but now back to waves of dizziness but thankfully no nausea. 
Some episodes put me in bed, bad ringing in ears and feeling like crap. Tinnitus is constant but gets worse with bad dizzy spells. 
Doc prescribed Meclizine but it makes me feel worse and does nothing for dizziness.
It's been a month of this now! Very difficult to work. Can't even walk the dog! I spend most of my day working in bed on my laptop. I just try to cram everything I need to do in between waves. I'm pretty tough and have been fighting through but it is really getting hard not to cry! To top it all off, I am also packing the house to move next week 18 hrs away!

Medical personel were on site in case anyone needed help. This is in the Netherlands.

Comment,1,gnwq305,,0,1613699030.0,"I just took my second shot 36 hours ago. My experience was as follows:

First shot-
 - Very sore arm at injection site for the first 48 hours that went away. 
- mild brain fog during the frost 24 similar to a fly shot in my experience

Second shot
- mild and persistent headache for the first 6 hours
- 10 hours after the shot was incredibly tired and went to bed
- woke up about 18 hrs after the shot with mild chill and thirst. Just drank water and went back to bed and injection site was sore similar to the first shot but not nearly as bad (also slept on that side so could be something)
- slept another 6 hours
- woke up still lethargic and mild headache (fortunately took off work) 
- muscle soreness throughout the day. Nothing horrible just feels like I worked out the day before but did not. 
- mild heachache off and on. 

Overall it feels like the tail end of the flu with some soreness and lethargy and a mild headache. It’s really not as bad as I expected and well worth it for immunity against the potential short and long term effects of covid (since we don’t know how it will effect each person). 

Overall I’m incredibly appreciative and elated to have the opportunity to be vaccinated. Still another 10 days or so to build up immunity but thrilled and these minor side effects that I experienced are well worth it. Four coworkers vaccinated at the same time had similar symptoms. Headache, soreness, chills first night, lethargy for 48 hours or so, seem to be common. 

If you are eligible and can get it then please do!

Edit: will update in a few days to let everyone know how things are going at 48 and 72 hours later.",2021-02-19 03:43:50

These are most lily to occur 15 min after the shot and they make you wait to monitor you after the shot.

Also last week I got the worst migraine of my life, it lasted two whole days, with NOTHING being able to quell it, idk if this was bc of the vaccine, I usually get 4 or 5 migraines a year and two Tylenol always takes it away quickly so idk, what do you guys think?... also I got nauseous the day after the vaccine but not too bad but that got worse, it wasn't until the 7th or 8th that my nausea started affecting my diet, on the 10th I got so nauseous I couldn't stomach anything at all, I had to force feed myself but with just a little bit a food, my stomach therefore, I assume, started hurting a lot... Since then (AND I REALLY WANT TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE HAS/IS EXPERIENCING THIS) my nausea comes and goes every day, for hours I'll be so sick but then I'll feel fine for a few hours and then it comes back full force. My symptoms really didn't start until several days after my first dose and just got progressively worse. I honestly thought I had or might have something serious going on, I just haven't heard of anyone having so many bad reactions to it for so long. Has/is anyone felt similar?

Walgreens currently only lets you do 21-22. I plan to change the date of my first one on their form to a day after my first dose so I can schedule me second one for a Friday so I don’t miss work if I feel like shit after.

CDC as of 2/10/21

“Persons should not be scheduled to receive the second dose earlier than recommended (i.e., 3 weeks [Pfizer-BioNTech] or 1 month [Moderna]). However, second doses administered within a grace period of 4 days earlier than the recommended date for the second dose are still considered valid. Doses inadvertently administered earlier than the grace period should not be repeated.

The second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. However, if it is not feasible to adhere to the recommended interval and a delay in vaccination is unavoidable, the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may be administered up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There are currently limited data on efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered beyond this window.

Comment,2,gmuif1z,,0,1613011927.0,"It anyone thinks this only my opinion, it’s definitely not. Most of this information is right on the CDC WEBSITE but people get lazy. The media interchanges the word AUTHORIZATION for APPROVED and they are NOT the same!!!  FDA APPROVED means they have stamped it for safety and efficacy and you can sue them for adverse side effects or allergic reactions. They are all getting a free pass now. People are actually volunteering to be tested with no legal recourse. 

It actually states on the CDC WEBSITE that MOST people recover from covid. There are approximately 400,000+ deaths to covid in the USA right now with a population of over 360,000,000 people!!! We lose over 450,000 people a year to cigarettes and vaping promoted and legalized because of the tobacco lobbyists hiding in the shadows of our representatives. If covid could be taxed, our doors would fly open. This is a money maker. Period.

This is a virus that has infected a lot of people but FEW die of it. I WILL NOT take any drug from a pharmaceutical company that is driven by profits. If people don’t believe that, look up the $9 billion dollar lawsuit just settled with Purdue pharmaceutical company for lying about OxyContin addiction!!!

I got censored for stating what is on the CDC website and the WHO website. You can also still get covid after the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. People have gone into anaphylactic shock after the first dose.  Be sure anyone willing to get the vaccine understands the risks. An Epi-pen is required to be at EVERY vaccination center.!!

I started feeling the chills and aches approx 10ish hours  after the vaccine and then immediately slept all night before my full day of feeling bad. I would say definitely REST, regardless of how you are feeling, as much as possible for the next 24-48 hours so your body can do what it needs to do. Don’t stay up late, don’t eat junk, keep hydrated, and just rest/sleep any time you don’t have to be at work. I hope you are one of the lucky ones who doesn’t have it too bad. Also, some people have been worried about taking pain relievers for their symptoms for fear of it causing the vaccine to not work as well.

My first dose symptoms kicked in on day 2 and 3 the hardest. I felt waves of just... Feeling icky and fatigued, slightly nauseated. Pain in my armpit (weird but ok, didn't think much of it then)

2.5 weeks later
Second dose, much bigger reaction. Next day I'm feeling waves of Runny nose, chills, upset stomach, and fatigued. Then swelling started in my arm pit and the underside of my arm which received the injection.  Freaked out, I look it up and found that this is turning out to be a known side effect. Yesterday the swelling was big and slightly warmer to the touch, uncomfortable. I took tylenol and it helped WAY more than Ibuprofen did. Last night before bed the site got itchy and gave me some little hives but those went away. I slept in a bit extra and I'm feeling much better today, lymph swelling is way down. No icky waves yet.

I should mention I'm technically obese and have some skin problems like allergies to fragrances and psoriasis. I was eager to get the vaccine but feel kinda bummed it hit so hard. I want to encourage others to get it ASAP but want to be transparent that the side effects are a bit uncomfortable. If anyone has feedback for me I'm all ears.

My full experience was this: 
Vaccination date: first dose of the Pfizer Vaccine Sunday, 24th of January

I have a history of anaphylactic shocks (three) and I administered antihistamines before getting the shot as prevention. I did NOT have any allergic reaction to the vaccine in these conditions.

First 48hrs:
- sore muscle in my arm, where vaccine shot was
- slightly elevated body temperature (37.1)
- slight tiredness and body chills (kind of like when you are very early in catching a cold)
- a bit of nausea

10 days after vaccination:
- I have had trouble sleeping, but this might be attributed to having a stressful period",2021-02-03 00:39:57

There are 80+ FDA approved vaccines on the market right now. I cannot speak to the litigious actions of a person toward some pharmaceutical’s vaccine; however, I did comment in an earlier subreddit about my shot #1 of the COVID-19 vaccine experience. I was taking a vaccine that was only licensed for EUA and not full FDA Approval. I still made the choice to get the shot and I will have to live/(hopefully not die) with the consequences of it. 

The 33 Norwegians who died were all 80 or older who received the shot and were not in the best of health according to the reports I read; this by no way lessons the impact of choosing to willingly take this 2-part shot, yet I would assume they all also chose to get it freely.
