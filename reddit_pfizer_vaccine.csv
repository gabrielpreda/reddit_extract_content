NO VACCINE IS FDA APPROVED!!! You can‚Äôt sue ANYONE if you have adverse side effects or allergic reactions. Ask the 43 families who lost loved ones in Norway!!! AUTHORIZATION is not FDA APPROVED!!!,0,la5jlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/la5jlp/no_vaccine_is_fda_approved_you_cant_sue_anyone_if/,22,1612221852.0,,2021-02-02 01:24:12
Comment,2,gmt9wbk,,0,1612991920.0,"There is no FDA approved vaccine for covid. AUTHORIZATION is not FDA approval!!! They are VERY different things. You are basically a volunteer test subject for the pharmaceutical companies. You can‚Äôt sue anyone if you have adverse effects or allergic reactions. No one!!! The media is not showing African protests over their population being used as test subjects. It appears that suddenly the pharmaceutical companies are trusted by USA and other countries now? Purdue pharmaceutical company just settled for $9 billion dollars for lying to people about OxyContin and its addiction yet, people believe that they care about your health?!! 

I got censored for stating what is on the CDC website and the WHO website. You can also still get covid after the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. People have gone into anaphylactic shock after the first dose.  Be sure anyone willing to get the vaccine understands the risks. An Epi-pen is required to be at EVERY vaccination center.!! Per the CDC WEBSITE ‚ÄúMOST PEOPLE RECOVER FROM COVID.‚Äù  If this post gets censored for quoting the CDC‚Äôs own website, be very concerned!!!",2021-02-10 23:18:40
Comment,1,gqerdep,,0,1615376901.0,"Got mine earlier today.  These side effects are no joke. My past vaccine experience is that I typically feel a bit tired after a flu shot, but this is far more intense. 

I have a sore arm and feel like I have a low grade cold/flu - but without any drippage or throat problems. Just feel warm all over, achy, tired. 

I also feel a little bit... weird... not sure if it is psychosomatic or what. I was singing  ""Oh give me a home, where the buffalo roam"" in my car which is a bit unusual. 

I think some of it might be psychosomatic. I have spent several hundred hours consuming media about this epidemic - the MIT lecture series, MedCram, Ninja Nerd, The Guardian, all of it. So I feel off, but also like kind of amazing, like this thing is coming to an end, and my body is a small part of this fight.",2021-03-10 13:48:21

Very quick and not a big deal getting it. I‚Äôm usually a fainter, but I was fine. They suggested taking Tylenol when I got home and I did. Woke up a little sore in that arm this morning, but when I say little, hardly at all.

Edited to add: 2/19/21 (Friday) I received my second dose. My arm was a little sore the next day, but not as bad as the first shot. I had a bad headache around midnight on Saturday, could be unrelated, I get them occasionally. No other side effects thank goodness.

FDA APPROVED means they have stamped it for safety and efficacy and you can sue them for adverse side effects or allergic reactions. They are all getting a free pass now.

It actually states on the CDC WEBSITE that MOST people recover from covid. There are approximately 400,000+ deaths to covid in the USA right now with a population of over 360,000,000 people!!! We lose over 450,000 people a year to cigarettes and vaping promoted and legalized because of the tobacco lobbyists hiding in the shadows of our representatives. If covid could be taxed, our doors would fly open. This is a money maker. Period.

This is a virus that has infected a lot of people but FEW die of it. I WILL NOT take any drug from a pharmaceutical company that is driven by profits.

The 33 Norwegians who died were all 80 or older who received the shot and were not in the best of health according to the reports I read; this by no way lessons the impact of choosing to willingly take this 2-part shot, yet I would assume they all also chose to get it freely.

Day 0 (Day of 1st shot): Mild sore arm. 
Day 1: Mild sore arm.  I also developed pretty bad brain fog, and sinus pressure.  
Day 2: Brain fog continued. Moderate/severe fatigue. Almost fell asleep bathing my kids which is crazy.
Day 3: Still have mild brain fog but fatigue has improved.
Day 4: Mild fatigue and mild brain fog.  Evening my stomach felt a little off.  I then woke up at 1:00 am with terrible stomach cramps/diarrhea.  I felt like I was going to vomit.  I also developed nasal congestion/runny nose.
Day 5: Upset stomach/diarrhea/fatigue and mild headache (mild nasal congestion)

My first dose symptoms kicked in on day 2 and 3 the hardest. I felt waves of just... Feeling icky and fatigued, slightly nauseated. Pain in my armpit (weird but ok, didn't think much of it then)

2.5 weeks later
Second dose, much bigger reaction. Next day I'm feeling waves of Runny nose, chills, upset stomach, and fatigued. Then swelling started in my arm pit and the underside of my arm which received the injection.  Freaked out, I look it up and found that this is turning out to be a known side effect. Yesterday the swelling was big and slightly warmer to the touch, uncomfortable. I took tylenol and it helped WAY more than Ibuprofen did. Last night before bed the site got itchy and gave me some little hives but those went away. I slept in a bit extra and I'm feeling much better today, lymph swelling is way down. No icky waves yet.

I should mention I'm technically obese and have some skin problems like allergies to fragrances and psoriasis. I was eager to get the vaccine but feel kinda bummed it hit so hard. I want to encourage others to get it ASAP but want to be transparent that the side effects are a bit uncomfortable. If anyone has feedback for me I'm all ears.

Additionally, the review board that makes the decision is an independent organization. While the approval is emergency use, both vaccines currently on the market are in the pipeline for full approval. You absolutely have recourse because a long time ago, a fund was set up for anyone that experienced a true adverse reaction to ANY vaccine. The purpose of the fund is to discourage litigation but also provide more immediate and long term financial relief for anyone that suffered injury due to vaccines. The fund does not stop litigation in the most litigious society in the world.

Walgreens currently only lets you do 21-22. I plan to change the date of my first one on their form to a day after my first dose so I can schedule me second one for a Friday so I don‚Äôt miss work if I feel like shit after.

CDC as of 2/10/21

‚ÄúPersons should not be scheduled to receive the second dose earlier than recommended (i.e., 3 weeks [Pfizer-BioNTech] or 1 month [Moderna]). However, second doses administered within a grace period of 4 days earlier than the recommended date for the second dose are still considered valid. Doses inadvertently administered earlier than the grace period should not be repeated.

The second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. However, if it is not feasible to adhere to the recommended interval and a delay in vaccination is unavoidable, the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may be administered up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There are currently limited data on efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered beyond this window. If the second dose is administered beyond these intervals, there is no need to restart the series.‚Äù

During this time, VAERS received 934 reports of death* (0.0018%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports. A review of available clinical information including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records findings revealed no link with vaccination.

I could not even open my eyes forv2 days without throwing up. Cat scan. MRI, blood work all ok. 
Dr said could very well be vertigo brought on by vaccine even though no live virus in vaccine your body doesn't know that. There is a viral type of vertigo. 
Went for second vaccine since doc said better than getting covid. I actually had two days feeling better after 2nd shot but now back to waves of dizziness but thankfully no nausea. 
Some episodes put me in bed, bad ringing in ears and feeling like crap. Tinnitus is constant but gets worse with bad dizzy spells. 
Doc prescribed Meclizine but it makes me feel worse and does nothing for dizziness.
It's been a month of this now! Very difficult to work. Can't even walk the dog! I spend most of my day working in bed on my laptop. I just try to cram everything I need to do in between waves. I'm pretty tough and have been fighting through but it is really getting hard not to cry! To top it all off, I am also packing the house to move next week 18 hrs away!

Comment,1,gnwq305,,0,1613699030.0,"I just took my second shot 36 hours ago. My experience was as follows:

First shot-
 - Very sore arm at injection site for the first 48 hours that went away. 
- mild brain fog during the frost 24 similar to a fly shot in my experience

Second shot
- mild and persistent headache for the first 6 hours
- 10 hours after the shot was incredibly tired and went to bed
- woke up about 18 hrs after the shot with mild chill and thirst. Just drank water and went back to bed and injection site was sore similar to the first shot but not nearly as bad (also slept on that side so could be something)
- slept another 6 hours
- woke up still lethargic and mild headache (fortunately took off work) 
- muscle soreness throughout the day. Nothing horrible just feels like I worked out the day before but did not. 
- mild heachache off and on. 

Overall it feels like the tail end of the flu with some soreness and lethargy and a mild headache. It‚Äôs really not as bad as I expected and well worth it for immunity against the potential short and long term effects of covid (since we don‚Äôt know how it will effect each person). 

Overall I‚Äôm incredibly appreciative and elated to have the opportunity to be vaccinated. Still another 10 days or so to build up immunity but thrilled and these minor side effects that I experienced are well worth it. Four coworkers vaccinated at the same time had similar symptoms. Headache, soreness, chills first night, lethargy for 48 hours or so, seem to be common.

Just because a drug isn‚Äôt produced by an American company doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt be made available to Americans under different names. (You ever heard of generic drugs?!) 

20,000 Americans, including pregnant women, were given thalidomide in ‚Äúchemical trials‚Äù in the early 1960‚Äôs causing thousands of deaths and miscarriages along with babies born with malformed limbs. The pharmaceutical company that did this trial with thalidomide was an American company called Richardson-Merrill and Smith, Kline.  Sound familiar?  The side effects were not obvious immediately just as those aren‚Äôt for all these experimental covid vaccines.  When you volunteer to be in a clinical trial for a drug that is not proven safe or effective, you have no legal rights. 

Please be sure to read the fine print before you get a vaccine that has been FDA EUA for use only NOT for FDA APPROVAL and even FDA approval is suspect after President Obama signed legislation that pushes pharmaceutical drugs to market with less research requirements.

Purdue pharmaceutical company just got slapped with a $9 billion dollar fine and 3 criminal charges for lying to the public about opioid addiction!!! Bayer pharmaceutical company is also facing criminal charges. We have a world wide opioid epidemic that is caused by your trusted pharmaceutical companies!!! 

Obama sighed legislation fast tracking drugs through the already overwhelmed FDA that have turned out to not be safe.  Some carry black box warnings now. Many,‚Äò many drugs have been recalled for death and injuries. Ever hear of thalidomide?!!! Please look it up!!! 

If you are at high risk, obese, have type 2 diabetes, have high blood pressure and are just plain basically unhealthy, you certainly should consider a vaccine otherwise, the cdc states on THEIR website that MOST people recover from covid at home! .1% of the entire population of the USA has died of covid.  .1%!!!   We lose more people to health problems related to cigarettes but YOU think the government and pharmaceutical companies care how you die?  

Over 500,000 people die each year from cigarettes but ‚Äúthey‚Äù don‚Äôt care because ‚Äúthey‚Äù tax the hell out of cigarettes. If ‚Äúthey‚Äù cared, we‚Äôd all have affordable health care and cigarettes would be illegal. You have no one to sue if 6 months from now or 4 years you get ANY adverse side effects or allergic reactions to these covid vaccines because they are NOT FDA APPROVED!!! NO ONE IS LIABLE FOR ANY ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS OR ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO ANY COVID VACCINE!! Authorization is not FDA approved!!! 

If covid could be taxed, our doors would fly open!!! It‚Äôs about money!!!  Good luck üëçüèº",2021-03-01 21:03:45

Comment,1,gp2uxsc,,0,1614488872.0,"Been experiencing similar symptoms to what I've been reading here, which makes me feel a bit better today since I'm not alone in this. A little background on me: I'm 38 (m) non smoker, extremely active run/workout 5/6 days a week, fairly healthy balanced diet, no known prexisting conditions. 

Got my first dose of Pfizer on Saturday (2/20). No immediate effects noticed. 

Day 1 - Sunday: Arm soreness, nothing else 

Day 2 - Monday: I feel fine, back to normal. Arm soreness gone. Was able to workout without a problem.

Day 3 - Tuesday: Tuesday evening began to develop a fever. Had chills and cold sweats. Fever went to 102 F.

Day 4 - Wednesday: Fever was up and down, started to develop a sore throat, minor congestion. At this point I was convinced that I caught Covid based on symptoms and went and got tested. Had very low energy and continued to sleep throughout most of the day. 

Day 5 - Thursday: No fever today, but still very lethargic and low energy. Sore throat persists. Results from Covid test came back negative. 

Day 6 - Friday: My body still feels run down. Attempted to workout. It was a struggle and felt like I was working out hungover. Also developed a headache which seemed to be concentrated behind my eyes. Low grade fever (99F) and still super tired. Sore throat isn't as bad as the day before.

Day 7 - Saturday: Slept 13 hours and headache still persists. Sore throat seems to be gone but I'm still low energy and running a low fever (99F). Have not moved from bed. 

I'm thankful to have the vaccine but coincidentally had a week off from work. I couldn't imagine going to work and being productive with these symptoms. If the second dose is allegedly worse, I do not look forward to it. 

Side note: I have been reporting my symptoms to the daily V-safe texts that I get from the CDC.",2021-02-28 07:07:52

I always had problems with my sinuses, I would get sick every year but never had long term effects like covid did to me. So Mr. Square person who likes the supermarkets, yes vaccine isn't approved and yes it can kill but so do all other APPROVED vaccines can kill too. If the person knows he/she has had problems with vaccines before, or has many allergies well is better not to get vaccinated.

Comment,4,gotg8vk,,0,1614366795.0,"I‚Äôve had both injections, my second on Monday (today is Friday for those reading this at a later date). I‚Äôm a teacher who has been in-person since August with underlying health conditions, so any complaints I have take a backseat to the protection it affords.

First injection: got it in the afternoon with no initial symptoms other than some fatigue later that evening. The next morning I woke up and felt like I had fallen on a doorknob with the shoulder that received the shot, which is an atypical reaction for me when receiving vaccinations. I did my usual activities, including some light tree pruning, cursing my arm because it hurt but it didn‚Äôt hinder my activities greatly. The next morning that pain was gone and I had no other symptoms.

Second injection: noticed swollen lymph nodes under the injection arm that are sensitive to the touch. I may be running a slight temperature or I may be overheating easier. I‚Äôve had some mental health issues: increased anxiety and mood swings. My physiology is particularly sensitive to vaccines and medications in general (I don‚Äôt know why, my psychiatrist doesn‚Äôt know why‚Äîjust lucky, I guess /s). It‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt recognize and deal with, since I‚Äôve gotten used to living in this body with its many quirks.

Comment,3,goqmaug,,0,1614308632.0,"I am 13 days out from first Pfizer shot. No real issues until about day 7, then started this persistent daily headache. I can‚Äôt get rid of it, tylenol etc does nothing. Since I do NOT have Covid it must be a reaction to antibodies but I can‚Äôt do my usual things with this pain. In researching Covid related headaches there are some NIH articles you can find, OTC things to reduce inflammation and even allergic-type response. I am hoping this headache stops soon‚Äî probably right before my second shot.
UPDATE:
My headache succumbed to Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen, aspirin, caffeine) and Salonpas small patches on my temples (menthol, camphor, etc, not the lidocaine ones altho my doctor recommended those too, as well as recommended nicotine patches). Anyway it stopped about two days before my second shot.
After my second shot I was flat out for 36 hours with body, joint pain, tiredness, and low grade fever. The next day I was mostly normal. Headache stayed on for four or five days but was able to knock it back with the Excedrin Migraine once a day.

Comment,2,gq6vaep,,0,1615219478.0,"My wife and I received our first dose March 3rd. I had been wanting to read other people's experiences because of a positive side effect I experienced. I will probably make a post of my own about this topic later. Anyhow, I had slight tiredness in my shoulder, but it lasted no more than an hour. My wife on the other hand, had soreness all day and felt sleepy. I was infused with a burst of energy. So, while she slept all evening I did chores around the house and went to Costco to get stuff we needed and still managed to work on things for my job well into the night (I'm a teacher). The next day I noticed I woke up with a rock hard erection, common I know, but lately my libido has been down. The pandemic has done a number on my overall health. I spend all day sitting at my desk teaching through Zoom or grading, or other stuff. I currently live a very sedentary life. That day, however, I made love to my wife 3 straight times. I hadn't done that in 20 years. I made love to her again the next day and the day after. She doesn't even want to see me in the bedroom anymore. My erections are completely hard and lasting which I can't say was the case prior to the vaccine. Has anyone had this experience?",2021-03-08 18:04:38

Comment,2,gq3rsyl,,0,1615160193.0,"First Dose: Absolutely no reaction.

Second dose: 6-8 hours after vaccine, felt tired and slightly foggy- went to sleep.

12 hours after vaccine: woke up with body aches and a headache.  7/10 on pain scale each.

From this point, fever went between 99.9 F and 100.5 F for 18 hours- diminished appetite as well.

During this time, I was in bed- I would wake up with the head ache and body aches and I would have this need to stretch and move to try to ""escape the pain"" but there was no getting away from it this way.

Taking several hot showers really helped ease the body aches and even helped the head ache momentarily.

30 hours after vaccine: fever vanished, body aches and head ache went to a 2/10.  Got up and ate.

36 hours after vaccine: Head ache gone- body aches mostly gone (1/10)

48 hours after vaccine: Body aches gone- I noticed some of my lymph nodes on the side the shot was taken are sore.

Comment,2,gpm3mif,,0,1614857017.0,"I‚Äôm about 6 days past my second dose. 

1st dose‚Äîa breeze! Just pain in the arm. 

2nd dose‚ÄîWoke up with slight chills and body aches after receiving it the night before. As the day went on it got progressively worse. From about 11-630 I had really bad chills and body aches. It honestly felt like I had been in a car accident! It was very uncomfortable!! But as random as it came on, it also went away randomly! Around 630 I started feeling better. I slept about 9 hours that night and woke up the next day feeling fine! 

When I woke up I had barely any pain where I received the shot but I did have pain in my armpit for about 2 days! I checked and it said some people get pain there due to their lymph nodes!

By the next day I started feeling extremely fatigued, all over achey/muscle fatigue and chills. Over the next few days to add to this I started feeling waves of nausea, dizzy spells and mad itches on arms. 
I'm now on day 8 and still experiencing all of the side effects.
Tried to go into work today and was sent home within the hour, currently awaiting call back from GP as I'm also concerned now at how long this is lasting with no relief or sign of improvement.

Comment,1,gpdit92,,0,1614683492.0,"Got mine first dose yesterday, Feb 28. Will update as long as I have effects, and when I receive the second dose. 

For reference: I typically have a reaction to flu shots. In 2018, I ended up swelling, bruising, and getting a rash, whereas most years I only get minor swelling and ache, and maybe a slight immune response ‚Äúlike the flu‚Äù. To be fair, I typically also get colds around the same time, I tend to get sick the week in October the same week I schedule my vaccine. I have had some reactions (mostly the swelling) to medications/injections, so I was required to wait for 30 mins post injection. 

Day 1, immediately post dose: absolutely nothing, I barely even felt the needle. 

Day 1, up to 6 hours: if anything, just tired. I had a 2 hour ride to the site I went to, and 2 hours back. Both in the pouring rain, about 40¬∞F. Didn‚Äôt eat til fairly late, and over ate at lunch. Could be many things. Ended up sleeping from 6pm until 9pm. 

Day 1, approx 8 hours post dose: arm started to get sore. This was about 10pm. Continued to get more sore overnight, ended up rolling onto arm while sleeping, which woke me up. 

Day 2: all day arm is pretty sore, sometimes for just pressure, sometimes it‚Äôs a constant sore. Guess depends on what I‚Äôm doing. Just spent approx. 2 hours meal prepping for the week, cutting veg and cooking, so it is a bit sore just from constant moving. It‚Äôs now 24 hours since soreness started (32 hours post dose) and I just took band aid off. No visible bruising/swelling etc.

Day 3: 48 hours later, soreness finally wore off. Small bruise, but no swelling. Let‚Äôs hope that‚Äôs the end of dose 1 side effects!",2021-03-02 13:11:32
Comment,1,gpddt13,,0,1614680805.0,"I received both doses as of 26th. The first dose was restricted to side effects of just pain at the injection site. I would rate it as moderate that lasted about 24 hours tops. Then all good. The second one had side effects very similar except far worse. My injection site was very sore that night (took my shot at 1:45PM). To the point that it kept me up late and I couldn't sleep on that side at all. I didn't take any pain meds just so I didn't reduce the efficacy. The next day the pain persisted, with redness and swelling and didn't reduce at all. I also had a small headache (less than moderate), just a small throb on and off. The following day, more of the same but with the shoulder pain reduced to moderate and below. Still a very small head throb every now and again. But now it is Mar 1st and I feel totally recovered. My shoulder feels the shot if I press against it but otherwise it is fine.

Comment,1,grrtfye,,0,1616410628.0,"Sorry you are having lingering side effects. That has to be frustrating not having full ROM especially considering the job you do. 

Here is the CDC link (if you are in the US) you should have been provided for tracking side effects. I assume you can still register though not sure how the reporting will differ since it‚Äôs been a bit since you got the vaccine. I originally was prompted to report daily, then weekly, and now I get a prompt ever couple of weeks. I think CDC is trying to document any and all types of side effects both long and short term so I‚Äôm sure your experience would be important. I think they also contact people under certain circumstances if there are unusual of lasting effects.

Now 3 days later I feel fine and have no pain or soreness. Also, 4 other people in my house got the Pfizer vaccine and had the same experience as me. Just remember to use your arm after you get it. I am an EMT and have seen what this virus can do to people. I have spoken with my colleagues who had Covid and received the vaccine and they all said they would much rather deal with the side effects than get Covid again. I hope this helps any of you who are worried, nervous or on the fence about getting the vaccine.

Second dose update. So I received my second dose 4/6 it is now 4/14 and all I had was a sore arm, no fever and I was tired. The tiredness was probably just from my regular day to day. Also, before I went and got the second dose I made sure to be well hydrated and drank a bottle of Pedialyte.

My arm was slightly sore around injection area.

Comment,8,gr7drr5,,0,1615983919.0,"No no no no no. Take a deep breath. So for the Pfizer vaccine there were over 43,000 people in the trials. A total of 6 people died over the course of several months during the trials. None of which had anything to do with the vaccine itself. 4 of them didn‚Äôt even receive the vaccine, they got the saline placebo. Of the 2 that were part of the trial and received the vaccine, one died of a heart attack over 2 months after getting the 2nd dose. And the other, who died 3 days after the first dose I believe, had (can‚Äôt remember the exact name of the condition) something that is essentially hardening of the arteries, like plaque buildup and such which happens over a long period of time usually from bad diet, smoking, genetics etc. All 6 were just in a very very large trial group and death for one reason or another just happens when you are considering such a large cross section of people of varying ages and health history. Please try not to stress about it. Do something nice for yourself to take your mind off of it. And when you do get your second vaccine, keep in mind that if you do experience any side effects (mostly feeling like you‚Äôve got the dang flu for 24 hours in most cases) have been fairly common. Just get rest and let your body do what it‚Äôs supposed to do and take comfort in knowing you‚Äôve done your part to help stop this awful virus AND protect yourself and your loved ones.

I‚Äôll try to remember to update after the 2nd shot.

I did have a 3 min panic attack while sitting in the waiting room for 15 min after the shot. That was the worse part!

Also if you‚Äôre just browsing through Reddit and looking for vaccine experiences from people, understand that these types of posts are probably heavily skewed towards people with negative experiences. More than likely, it doesn‚Äôt even cross someone‚Äôs mind to post updates when they had zero to little reactions to the vaccine. Just throwing that out there bc reading this thread made me super nervous getting my shot!

My friend in her early 40s, in shape,  not obese, had a full day of fever and body weakness after the 2nd moderna shot. But she said it only lasted like a day. But her fever did get to 101, which freaked her out.

**2ND SHOT UPDATE (3/30):** I got my 2nd shot yesterday. I have slight soreness on the spot on my shoulder where I got the shot. And I feel muscle soreness and maybe a tiny sluggish today.

When I woke up Wednesday, I felt 100% back to my normal self. Thank goodness. I'm absolutely dreading the second one, though.

Comment,5,gqt68py,,0,1615681238.0,"Hey everyone,

I had a lot of comfort and help from everyone posting observations on here and wanted to contribute.

I (20M) got my first dose 3 weeks ago. After getting it, I sat in the observation area for 15 minutes and didn‚Äôt feel much different (my arm didn‚Äôt even feel sore). I did feel tired, but it was towards the end of the work day.

During check out, they had me bring down my mask to check for rash/irritation. I had no symptoms in terms of that.

About 2-4 hours later, the inside of the arm that got jabbed started to feel itchy. It felt like my muscles were itching.

Right around that time I started to feel pretty tired. I fell asleep and woke up the next day feeling normal.

I felt normal since then. I was tired at points, but I usually feel tired due to poor sleep quality.

I got my second dose yesterday at 4:45PM. The process in the observation area was the same for me. Once again, I felt more tired, but it was towards the end of the work day.

I felt normal for afterwards. I went back to work and even did some physical activity after. I didn‚Äôt feel tired like the first one caused me to feel.

I went to sleep at around 12am and woke up at 4AM (12 hours from jab) with chills. Shortly after experiencing the chills, I had feelings of anxiety. 

The anxiety went away after a couple of minutes, but the chills persist. 

It is now 11:14am. I have chills (less intense), a headache (feels like when you sit on the couch for too long or go on the computer for too long), and slight dizziness.

I hope the symptoms end here and, in the end, am glad I had the opportunity to receive the vaccine. 

Good luck to everyone who received (or is receiving) the vaccine.",2021-03-14 02:20:38

This was related to ALL doses. Ymmv as reactions are different for everyone.",2021-03-13 08:46:37
Comment,2,gqqnh2y,,0,1615616655.0,"I had an antibody test about a month ago which came back positive meaning I had a mostly asymptomatic infection of Covid at some point. 

&#x200B;

I had heard that people previously infected can experience the stronger reaction from the first shot of the vaccine that most people experience after the second shot.

&#x200B;

It seems that was the case. I had the shot Tuesday afternoon and it is now Friday afternoon. Tuesday night I was more tired than normal and went to bed much earlier than normal. Wednesday, woke up in the morning after a rare 8 hours of sleep and still felt very tired and sleepy. Had a weird ""reverberating"" headache, different from the tension headaches I normally get. This was the type that hurts more when you cough or bend over.

Luckily this type of headache seemed to respond to pain relievers a lot more than my tension headaches normally do, so I made sure to stay on my doseage of alternating acetaminophen / ibuprofen. Took a nap Wednesday afternoon. After that, went out to buy a coffee and the clouds seemed to dissipate and I started feeling great from almost exactly 24 hours after the shot.

&#x200B;

Then the next day, Thursday, yesterday, I felt great, until the end of the day. I may have ""pushed it"" by going for a walk in the evening, after which I felt totally drained, which was concerning for me and weird. I went to bed early again last night. Seems like day two of symptoms was much more mild though, as I didn't have headache or chills or anything, just felt tired and sleepy.

&#x200B;

Today is Friday and I'm feeling great so far. Don't think I will go to the gym for a few days, just to be safe and save my energy. 

&#x200B;

I did not experience any nausea and the pain/swelling of the injection site was even less than I normally get from the flu vaccine.

&#x200B;

**Question:**

I've been trying to find (even anecdotal) information online about this but it's hard to find. I know the reaction to the first shot is expected to be bigger for those who had prior Covid infections. How does this fare for the second shot? Should I expect a similar reaction? A bigger one? A smaller one?",2021-03-13 08:24:15

Comment,2,gqnoscp,,0,1615552722.0,"Ello chums, got my first Pfizer vaccine 7 days ago and here is my experience so far:

Slight soreness in arm as expected, nothing crazy.

Day 2: had a sudden flash of fatigue, I was at work and felt stupid, could barely answer customer questions. Had my gf drive me home cus I didn‚Äôt feel safe to drive a car. Got home, watched a movie and 4 hours after the onset it cleared up it was really strange.

Day 3: no symptoms

Day 4: right at the end of the night felt ‚Äúnot good‚Äù but couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on what it was, drank a bunch of water and switched to a relaxing activity and that seemed to clear it up

Day 5: Woke up fine, I noticed my appetite was a bit suppressed and wasn‚Äôt able to eat much. Later in the night developed headache/chills/ and felt like the discomfort of a fever but not actually running hot. The night was rough, took many hot showers and sat in front of my mini heater most the time to satisfy the chills. Finally fell asleep and slept through till about 7am next day.

Day 6: Woke up a little more nauseated than the day before so had myself some alka seltzer (felt like a hang over) and immediately went back to bed cus of fatigue. Woke up around 11:00 am and though I was feeling better which was nice cus I was running behind on schoolwork so I was able to focus and get some of it done. Still had no appetite, could only intake liquids like water/smoothie/ and for some reason a banana was accepted by my body. Thought everything was groovy except around 6pm got hit with another wave of fatigue/headache/chills which sucked. Took an ibuprofen 200mg but stomach got upset because I haven‚Äôt been eating so no dice.Went back to the hot showers and heating fan and eventually fell asleep but felt very hot all night.

Day 7(today): Woke up feeling pretty normal, again got a banana down and a smoothie, tried some toast but no dice. Was able to get some more school work done but then again around 6pm hit by a wave of this fatigue/headache/nausea but definitely not as bad as the previous nights. Still haven‚Äôt been able to eat much which is also contributing to my headache and fatigue but drinking lots of water and also pedialyte seemed to help. This time took a ibuprofen 200mg again but tried to fill my stomach as much with water to avoid nausea and it seems to have helped, I‚Äôve kind of snapped out of my ‚Äúchills‚Äù state. 

I am 25 M, and don‚Äôt use any drugs or drink alcohol, I also don‚Äôt take any daily medications accept Claritin. I tried to provide as much details as possible to give those considering getting the vaccine an idea of my experience.

Helpful Notes:
If you‚Äôre gunna take hot showers, make sure to drink LOTS of water so you don‚Äôt get dehydrated .

Drink plenty of water.

If your appetite is messed up like mine try to eat liquid foods that have calories so your body has something to work with (applesauce/smoothie) or whatever your body agrees with. Any amount of nutrients gives your body what it needs to fight off the invader (vaccine).

Try small doses of Ibuprofen if you can.

Hope this helps!",2021-03-12 14:38:42

First 12h after jab.

My arm hurt like properly hurt and felt heavy but didn't feel that bad. Blood sugar wise my control was average, no extremes.

12 - 48h

My arm was sore internally and I felt like crap, I noticed my sugars kept sky rocketing then crashing which is odd. 

48h to 72.

Major hankering for protein, donno why I just needed meat, the pain in my arm was subsiding and I could finally sleep on it.

72 h to One week on

So after about 72h my arm stopped hurting and all of the feeling like crap ended. However, I did notice that my bloods kept crashing, for about 2 days solid day 6 and 7 no matter what I did I could not get my sugars up, so I had hypos (low blood sugars) after hypos especially during the day.

Anyway I hope the above helps.",2021-03-09 17:54:25

Was a little nervous waiting in line, but the process was very easy. The shot itself doesn't hurt at all. Tried to keep my arm as relaxed as possible during administration of the vaccine. I didn't feel dizzy afterwards, if anything it was just a little high from an adrenaline rush. Chugged a bottle of water and felt totally fine. Earlier in the day I had eaten some fruit and snacks, as well as took some electrolyte supplements. 

Fast forward day 2 and there is still no symptoms other than a slightly sore arm which I am trying to keep moving and active. 

Will update after my 2nd shot and let you all know how I feel.

I think this is a great opportunity to help combat the pandemic. Yesterday on the radio I heard 7 Million people wont get the vaccine because they don't know it's FREE! The other half of people voluntarily not taking the vaccine happen to be republicans. Hahah what a world",2021-04-16 03:54:49

He also absolutely insisted to get the 2nd shot, and I was like 'everyone says the 2nd is the worst, I can't go through that hell again' and he assured me that I probably wouldn't have a reaction at all the second time, because my immune system built up a ton of antibodies during the month I was in hell.

But saying that Tylenol (which I said I take two, not one or two) does not help with migraines, which is what I assume you're implying, is false. It might not work for you or other people, but it does for me and a simple Google search reveals it does for many others as well.

I also had the virus in March, and can tell you 100% the virus is worse than the vaccine.  I stopped breathing in my sleep randomly several times and woke up gasping for air.  My o2 was in the 80‚Äôs when I checked.  The virus caused temporary central sleep apnea for me, among many other terrible things.

Comment,1,gs1lmy8,,0,1616620257.0,"Received my first dose last Wednesday at 3p in upper left arm. I had no issues the rest of the day.
Woke up Thursday at 4:30a for work. Felt like someone sucker punched me in the arm. Only tender to the touch but no tenderness when moving arm. 
7a my coworker shows up and I noticed a metallic odor. I questioned my coworker if he could smell it. He wasn‚Äôt sure. We both assumed it was something sprayed by maintenance working in another room. 
1p the metallic odor is now tasted in my donut and my lunch. It‚Äôs much more prominent. Both shoulders were also tender and warm. I felt drained. 
3p I felt even more tired. It was similar to the finale of a flu. No fever. Metallic smell and taste continued. 
5p we picked up dinner and ate. I felt physically better but my tastebuds were slightly off. 
7:30p I worked out with my Oculus. Noticed I was physically exhausted and my left upper arm was sore. I had to quit by 9p due to sudden vertigo and nausea (a first using the oculus). Immediately laid down due to strong nausea. Fell asleep. 
Friday 4:30a arm wasn‚Äôt as sore, no vertigo or nausea, but physically tried. I can smell and taste metal. 
By the afternoon, my lower left diaphragm felt tighter than usual. ‚ÄúElephant on the chest‚Äù feels in and off they the day. 
Saturday: smell and taste slightly metallic but more musty-like. Physically I felt better. Arm wasn‚Äôt tender. Chest still a little tight. No cough. 
Sunday: felt like crap all day. Sluggish physically and mentally. Chest tight and sore in both lower diaphragm. It reminds me of bronchitis minus no cough. I do has asthma but it‚Äôs usually accompanied with a cough when my lungs feel this way. Light headache. Laid down most of the day. Smeller and taste is still off. More of a musty smell than metallic. 
Monday: I felt physically better but both lungs were still tight in lower diaphragm. Felt tired by afternoon. Tastebuds and smeller still not quite right. 
Tuesday: no changes/same situation. Got tested for COVID. 
Wednesday: I feel more drained than the past two days. Lower lungs on fire. Tight chest. Coughed up a small chunk of phlegm at 6a and it didn‚Äôt smell nice. Taste buds and smeller still off. Waiting on my test result. Maybe I do have bronchitis for tis the season for it (spring allergies can trigger it). 
Prior to the Pfizer inoculation last Wednesday, I did NOT have any of the symptoms I had the next day or continue to have today. I hear the side effects last a couple of days. Mine have lasted 6 days. Fingers crossed I am COVID neg.",2021-03-24 23:10:57
Comment,2,gs1d71f,,0,1616615268.0,Just had my first Pfizer shot on March 22nd at 4:30 pm.

I really don't know how they can do this. Sure it's great to have more people get the first jab, but Pfizer was approved in Canada based on the original Phase III s. In those, everyone got second dose after 21 days. 

We will have some sort of protection between 14 days and whenever we get the second dose. But nobody really knows how well we will be protected. No trials have been done with second dose after 16 weeks. They are using us as guinea pigs.

Comment,2,gsmy60p,,0,1617007169.0,"Hi all, I had my second Pfizer vaccination 10 days ago. Felt fine until about 12 hours later, then it kicked me in the pants so to speak. I was told that at 62 year old I might expect mild side effects. Not at all mild for me. My arm was a only mildly sore but I became extremely lightheaded... like I had a couple bottles of wine without being buzzed. Rather I had sort of stoned feeling and not a good stoned like the last time I used drugs in the 1980‚Äôs lol.  I was moving about badly, could not walk a straight line to save my life. That persisted and very slowly diminished over 7-8 days. I also had chills and sweating for about 3-4 days. Muscle aches and pain ramped up and have just now started to subside. Nasty headache for 2 days, significant lethargy and fatigue still occurs. Also became a bit cranky and depressed which are quite unusual for me. Crankiness is gone, depression remains as does muscle pain. Bottom line is this, it has kicked my ass. Is it worth it, yes. I‚Äôve had numerous friends become ill with Covid, another friend is in the VA ICE as I write this. Also have lost 2 acquaintances to Covid. Let‚Äôs all hope and pray that there are not long term consequences to the vaccine. There are no long term studies so far, they are sure to begin appearing at some point. I‚Äôm betting there will be some long haulers who endure side effects but time will tell. All in all, I‚Äôm glad I have been vaccinated. As I ‚Äújoked‚Äù  with my wife while we  were watching I Am Legend and awaiting vaccination, ‚Äúwe are either going to be one of the zombies or 2 of the people being chased down by the zombies‚Äù I am of course being facetious, nothing like would ever occur. We are going to now enjoy a healing cocktail while watching Steven Kings ‚ÄúThe Stand lol. I wish you all good health and a happy lifeüò≥",2021-03-29 11:39:29

First shot:

Absolutely no symptoms.  Sore arm the day after the shot, but then quickly subsided.

Second shot:

Day 1: About two hours after, my arm started to get sore, which was sooner than the first shot.

Day 2: Woke up around 4:00 a.m. with chills and aches.  Didn't take my temperature until 6:00 a.m. which was 100.8F.  By 9:00 a.m. I felt substantially better with a fever of 99.7F.  by 3:00 p.m. I still felt fatigued with a temperature of 99.3F.  9:00 p.m. I felt almost 100% back to normal, just a little more tired than usual.

Comment,1,gsh6xz1,,0,1616894251.0,"I got my first dose last Thursday.  I have been sick for days.  What's interesting is that my husband received the Moderna vaccine (1st dose) on Friday and he is tracking with almost the same symptoms as mine but seems to be about 24-36 hours behind me.  This has been crazy. If we had known we would experience this we would never have taken the vaccine.  We are both extremely healthy and practice Bikram Yoga 3-4 days per week.  I couldn't imagine getting through a yoga class anytime in the near future.  Symptoms are listed here:

  

Day 1: 

Sore arm (very sore), otherwise good. Normal day. No fever

Day 2: 

Sore arm, fatigue, chills??? (mild but present) and normal day. 90 Minute Hot Yoga class, fatigue but otherwise good. No fever

Day 3: 

Sore arm, fatigue, chills (mild), but I did a yoga class and aside from being extremely tired was fine. No fever

Day4: 

Fatigue got worse and had strange muscle pain, not like normal post exercise recovery. It was almost a burning soreness with muscle fatigue. No fever BP 130/72

Day 5: 

Fatigue, severe headache, stuffy nose, chills. Tylenol and Advil do nothing for the headache, can't sleep because of headache, chills and stuffy nose. No fever. Did a hot yoga class and mostly laid on the mat.

Day 6:

Insane crushing headache, Advil and Tylenol are still not doing much, lots of sinus pressure, can't sleep because of head congestion, sinus pressure and headache with chills, coughing ensued, sore glands and a strange tenderness in the back of my throught and roof of my mouth and fatigued. The headache is gripping and tinnitus is bad. No fever BP is 126/80

Day 7: 

The worst. All the symptoms from yesterday but slept most of the day and didn't leave the couch. Took cold medicine for congestion and Tylenol for headache. Slept off an on propped up on pillows. Tinnutis is bad. No fever

Day 8:

Woke up with a headache, less severe than yesterday. Chills and sweats are gone. Congestion seems to be lessening hour by hour. No joint or muscle pain. No fever BP is 127/70 

Advil is helping take the edge off the headache but it is ever present.

Day 9:

Still can‚Äôt sleep. Headache is mostly controlled with Adil and Tylenol. Sinuses are stuffy and fatigue comes and goes. Taste and smell are on and ff. I have a strange floral aroma and taste that stays with me all day. No fever",2021-03-28 04:17:31

2nd shot, arm soreness. About 20hr after shot, slight headache, fatigue, stomach slightly upset. Slept a lot. Woke up the following day feeling normal. A few days later I did have diarrhea but it's possible that was completely unrelated (diet changes).

It didn‚Äôt build up, it was like getting hit by a truck of fear.  I‚Äôm not at all vaccine hesitant so it wasn‚Äôt anxiety around that.  My brain just decided I definitely had inoperable cancer and that my husband and cat were about to die.

Comment,1,gt9cl13,,0,1617496942.0,"‚ÄúmRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine.

Future mRNA vaccine technology may allow for one vaccine to provide protection for multiple diseases, thus decreasing the number of shots needed for protection against common vaccine-preventable diseases.‚Äù

Comment,3,gt9bykx,,0,1617496616.0,"No. I‚Äôm not trying to start a war with people but not one of the vaccines are FDA approved for safety or efficacy. They got EUA which means the pharmaceutical companies can distribute the vaccines but they are not liable for the safety or efficacy of the vaccines. The media is guilty of interchanging the term APPROVED when authorization should be used. 

The government approved EUA of the vaccines but not FDA approved. It‚Äôs very different! They are approved for distribution not for being safe or effective against covid. The pharmaceutical companies have zero liability and are making a fortune off vaccines that normally are studied for about 10 years before getting FDA approval thus, the term EUA; EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION. 

If people want to get injected with an experimental vaccine because the benefits outweigh their risks, so be it but it is a personal decision to get ANY pharmaceutical drugs and is a decision to be made with their physician and it‚Äôs a personal decision. People have died from the vaccines. If you want to get one, it should be a choice. Why are we at war about this?  I definitely don‚Äôt want covid but almost everyone I know has had it. I‚Äôd rather get covid than the vaccine.  I have medical issues that preclude me from the risks of getting an experimental drug. That‚Äôs MY business.

Got my first Pfizer shot on March 22. Only had a sore arm most of the week. On the 26th(last Friday) I had a slight sore throat and body temp at 99F.  By that weekend I had body aches but fever was gone.

This week I started to have a strong cough and it's been getting worse to the point I can't sleep. No other symptoms besides respiratory.  Feels like I have some serious bronchitis and an asthmatic attack. I deal with allergic asthma and regular allergies so it is really wrecking me. I'm currently taking Allegra, Mucinex and an albuterol inhaler and it's not enough. Might need to go to urgent care if it gets any worse.

Comment,1,gt3i0e8,,0,1617355454.0,"Ok folks, I had my first dose on Saturday 3/27.

A few hours after I had a sore arm.  Not much else.  10 hours after I got hit like a Mack truck with a panic attack.  Just this deep sense of doom like I was going to die.  It‚Äôs 5 days later and the panic comes and goes, but it definitely comes back at some point every day.  Is anyone else having heightened anxiety *after* the shot???  I was prepared for the flu like symptoms, but I wasn‚Äôt prepared for this.  It‚Äôs really scary.  Please let me know if anyone else has had this happen.  A friend said her sister who is a doctor has had others report this, but the anxiety is so intense I can‚Äôt make it go away with just the one rationalization.

Also I‚Äôm not in any way vaccine hesitant.  I used to travel a lot and I‚Äôve had a bunch of vaccines and never worried about it.  I wasn‚Äôt worried about this one.",2021-04-02 12:24:14

Around hours 2-3, I felt fatigued and my arm became progressively sorer by the hour. Upon getting home, I fell asleep, waking up sweating after 3 hours with a very low grade fever (98.7 F). I felt nauseous most of that night, and my arm pain peaked between the 24-48 hour mark. I couldn‚Äôt sleep on that side for several nights and had trouble raising it more than a few inches. I‚Äôm now three days out, and that pain has subsided for the most part. I continue to feel fatigued, and have had to cut back on my exercise routine, but I‚Äôm in the process of changing my sleep schedule so that may play a factor. Looking forward to being fully vaccinated in a few weeks!

Comment,1,gxudfcy,,0,1620849603.0,"25 F I got my second shot yesterday morning.

First shot:

Sore arm started a couple of hours after. I was very fatigued and my body temp dropped late at night. I bundled up and rested a lot. Woke up feeling great and had no other symptoms.

Second shot: 

It's almost been 24 hours, but I'm much sicker this time. It started out the same where I got a sore arm a couple of hours later. I slowly started feeling worse. More than just body fatigue. It felt like the flu but a little worse. I tried to rest, but I couldn't sleep. Laid in bed in pain for hours until I finally got the energy to get some medicine and cried my body hurt so much. It hurt absolutely everywhere. My back, butt, feet, head, everywhere. I was running a fever this time, so I took some ibuprofen and only got two hours of sleep. I'm feeling a little better right now. Body is still a bit sore and my arm is sore if I move it too quickly, but it's not as intense. Still have a low grade fever despite taking more medicine.",2021-05-12 23:00:03

1st shot had sore arm at injection site immediately, achy and sore arm pit on the injection side, transient muscle aches, mostly on injection side of body. Insomnia. All lasted 4 days and resolved.

2nd shot. Sore arm at injection site. 4 hrs later, 100.3F fever. Mild fatigue. Entire arm and injection site soreness. 6 hrs the muscle aches started. By 8 hrs joint pain involved.  This lasted the next 24 hrs. Easily treated with Advil Dual (ibuprofen  + acetometaphin).

The first night, night severe diarrhea.  Like every hour for 6 hours. Didnt realize there was that much shit in the human body.

Woke on day 2 with sore and swelling lymph gland on the injection side arm pit. Can not wear a bra and tender to the touch. Muscle aches subsided. Joint pain more pronounced. 100F Fever transient, maybe 3 times spiked during the day. Diarrhea slowly decreased through mid afternoon and never reappeared. All aches treated with Dual Advil and hot Epsom salt bath. Insomnia persists.

Day 3. Aches subsided. No diarrhea. Fever gone. The under arm  swelling persists and is clearly visible. Injection site pain gone. Insomnia only half the night. Fatigue persists.

Days 4 to 6. Fatigue resolved. Only the underarm swelling persists but is  markedly decreasing in size. Minimal pain. No longer tender to the touch. Insomnia resolved by night 5. 

Day 7. Almost all side effects resolved. Armpit swelling gone and only tender under firm touch. No other side effects remain.

I get vaccine hesitancy and honestly don't want anyone to get it that isn't comfortable with it.  Having an injection of anything is a very personal choice.   There is no such thing as a medicine or vaccine with 0 risk.

Comment,1,gtgn2gc,,0,1617664892.0,"You ever hear of a cytokine storm?  Do you realize that you may be actually inviting covid to mutate by getting the vaccines?  Next fall, covid may come back as a SUPER bug because everyone is getting vaccinated. In order for this virus to mutate it needs live hosts. It will continue to mutate to survive.  If you allow your immune system to fight it, it will already have developed the antibiotics to protect the body. I wish you all the best. I‚Äôve studied this virus as much as humanly possible, not in the philosophical sense but the SCIENCE of viruses. 

I have a low grade respiratory infection called sinusitis caused by an off label prescription given to me by a physician. Two surgeries later, it won‚Äôt go away. I won‚Äôt risk getting a vaccine that is experimental with no long term knowledge of its side effects. I won‚Äôt risk dying from a vaccine that has no FDA approval. 

I have been mindful of getting covid. I‚Äôm covid free after a year of this. Do whatever makes you happy. I seriously don‚Äôt care if you want to get a vaccine, please do!!!  I DO care that the vaccines don‚Äôt prevent covid from reoccurring and quite possibly, are doing the exact opposite of what they are supposed to do. The vaccines are creating an environment for covid to mutate and become stronger and possibly, create a super bug. If that happens, God help humanity. We are already seeing mutations across the globe. Given that the human body has the ability to create its own antibodies to viruses ü¶†, I‚Äôll let my immune system continue to fight off covid which it‚Äôs done a good job of.

Comment,1,gtglxwy,,0,1617664377.0,"Pfizer doesn‚Äôt say 6 months. They just continue to follow vaccinated people from trials. And so far they just have 6 months of data of people being vaccinated. Some articles / titles worded this in a way that we can expect 6 months coverage, but it‚Äôs not that. 

It‚Äôs more, at 6 months, they still offer some pretty strong protection (around 91% if I recall). And this is really good news. 

https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/01/health/pfizer-covid-vaccine-efficacy-six-months-bn/index.html


The annual vaccination is just speculation for now. We need more data to see how the different vaccines will still be effective after a year. 

Here is an article that shows really good data after one shot of Pfizer / Moderna 

https://globalnews.ca/news/7727987/pfizer-moderna-one-shot-effectiveness-study/


Like you, my partner is at high risk of dying of Covid (organ transplant recipient, kidney disease and diabetes) and let‚Äôs face it, in order to protect vulnerable people, we need to get them vaccinated but we also need to get people surrounding them vaccinated. 
I still think the 4 months stretch is an acceptable compromise in order to protect a maximum of individuals and the community by extension.

Comment,1,gtgfusv,,0,1617661439.0,">I prefer 10 people at 70 / 80% efficacy, than 5 at 95% and 5 others left at 0%.

Firstly, maybe some are hoping, but nobody expects the vaccine to provide protection for a couple of years. Pfizer say maybe 6 months (the point of my post), others say probably a few months longer. More likely an annual dose, like flu, but only if administered properly in the first place (not happening here yet)

Regarding 1/2 vaccinating more people. Some of the population are more vulnerable than others. Some are exposed to more risk. That is why the initial rollout was to front line workers and seniors over 80. But even many of those (i am one) have had second dose extended to 4months.",2021-04-06 01:23:59
Comment,1,gtgewh7,,0,1617660955.0,"Nobody knows for sure. 
But, there are good chances that it won‚Äôt affect the efficacy negatively, even after 6 months. The 21 days is arbitrary. 

And let‚Äôs say, worst case scenario, our protection doesn‚Äôt last the couple of years they are hopping, we will probably be in a situation where vaccines are more widely available for all. 
I think the small trade off of personal protection is worth, considering it will allow to protect more people faster and potentially reduce the risk of developing variants.

Comment,1,gtdh2dx,,0,1617591594.0,"Pfizer say that their vaccine will provide protection for 6 months. This is based on getting both doses in the 21day time frame they recommend. Protection is in the 91% efficacy range.

[https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/pfizer-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-protection-lasts-at-least-six-months-1.5371115](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/pfizer-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-protection-lasts-at-least-six-months-1.5371115)

Here in Ontario we get one dose. Then we wait 4 months for second dose. No data published on what protection we have after 4 months. Or how much additional protection we get after 2nd dose and for how long.

Canadians are totally out on their own on this. No other country is doing this. As a result, there is no data to back up what our health authorities have dictated.",2021-04-05 05:59:54

I think they would happily trade their experience, if they could. Good luck with the second shot, and congratulations on getting one step closer to normalcy again!

Comment,1,gto05m8,,0,1617812278.0,"I also experienced swollen lymph nodes on the opposite side, in my armpit, neck, and under my jaw. Everything I've read suggests that it's common to experience it on the same side as the shot, but mine, like yours, were only swollen on the opposite side. I also had a second wave - for me, after the initial reaction (aches, joint pain, fatigue) resolved, I felt better for a day, and then the lymph nodes swelled and became painful. They have improved a bit but are still noticeably tender five days after the shot (two days after first becoming swollen). In discussing it with friends and family, five other women (three pre-menopausal, two post-menopausal) said they had a delayed second wave of side effects, so I think it is actually pretty common, even though we don't hear about that possibility! I hope you feel better soon! Despite the discomfort, I'm eager to get the second shot. What we're feeling is better than COVID, itself. Seeing what long-haulers endure, I'll take some swollen lymph nodes for a few days in exchange for protection from COVID!  
Also, definitely report your side effects to [vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html](https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html?fbclid=IwAR3plEMbSRh4pvdYxbOuww7UwTX-Bd0QBhSxTiKSLkxddz_2USpmPr1BvuE), so they know that these side effects do happen.

So far just a very sore arm and a bit of fatigue. Thanks for sharing your experiences, everyone! Knowing what to expect took the edge of my anxiety.

Update: Felt fine until about 13 hours post vaccine. Currently under a pile of blankets with severe muscle aches, chills, headache, and a low grade fever. I‚Äôm not going to sugarcoat it, the aches have me on the verge of tears. Took Tylenol and hoping that l can get some sleep. I do have a very reactive immune system. My partner also got his second dose and he is fine apart from a very sore arm. I‚Äôll update in the morning!

Day 2 Update: fever finally broke at 4am. Felt bad all day but thankfully fever and chills are gone. Headache, brain fog, and muscle soreness. I have a very reactive immune system in general, so I‚Äôm not all that surprised, but my symptoms were more severe than I expected! It‚Äôs 8pm now and I‚Äôm exhausted and achey.

Comment,8,gu1vaxw,,0,1618097669.0,"Hey all, I was SO NERVOUS to get my 2nd dose after reading through this thread but I wanted to share my experience in hopes it helps ease some anxiety. 

I am mental - I spent the past 5 weeks scouring the internet and social media for ANY information I could find on the Pfizer vaccine. Whether good or bad I just wanted all the information I could to make the best decision. 

Dose 1 - I got it on March 13th and I was extremely nervous. I got my dose, waited the 15 minutes and drove home. I was extremely anxious and just kept taking deep breaths to calm myself. To keep my mind busy I decided to go to Target (because Target is calming and the best). Walking through target I felt in a daze. I felt loopy and a bit dizzy, but by the time I left Target I felt much better. That day I cleaned my apartment and used my arm as much as I could to help the soreness. I went to bed with a sore arm and woke up the next morning with ZERO soreness. The next week or so I had a VERY mild headache (1 on a scale of 1-10) and a bit of dizziness but again, my anxiety causes this feeling too. I felt 95% from day 2 after getting my first shot on. 

Yesterday at 8:15AM after being EVEN MORE nervous for my 2nd shot, I received my 2nd Pfizer shot. I waited the 15 mins, went home and felt fantastic! I went for a 4 mile walk as it was gorgeous outside - came home and worked. Last night I took 1 Tylenol extra strength in preparation to wake up to feeling like I was hit by a truck. I slept great, woke up this morning and I am now 26 hours post vaccine and feel 100%! NO headache, NO fever, NO chills, no chest pains no dizziness no nausea, no fatigue...

I feel fantastic. 

I read that taking a good multivitamin and keeping hydrated helped, so that‚Äôs all I did in preparation of the shot. I am 31 and 155 pounds and have asthma and horrible seasonal allergies.

My husband, my sister in law, my mother in law, my father in law, my father, my best friend, my boss, my coworker, her boyfriend, and my nurse friend all felt the exact same way. NO issues with shot 2, or very MINOR issues like being sleepy or a mild headache. Maybe we are the lucky ones, but that‚Äôs 11 of us - all with minimal ANYTHING with both shots. 

Maybe shot two will still hit me later, but I am relieved and thankful.

Fever lasted about 8 hours and getting out of bed was a chore. It was a tough day, unlike anything ive ever experienced

Next day I felt 65%, enough to get out of bed and work but was still getting chills and fever. 

Day 3 85%. Mild headaches throughout the day but had enough sitting around and walked and played 9 holes of golf. Played amazing.. maybe it‚Äôs the shot. 

Day 4 - woke up with a headache still feeling a little fatigue and now have a mild dry cough. Mind is racing. Do I have Covid?

Anyone experience anything similar? Should I get tested or is this just my body fighting back?

2nd shot - Received yesterday at 4pm.

Day 2 of 2nd shot: Completely back to normal except for armpit pain.

Only side effect I had was soreness at injection site and a 45 minute episode of slight body aches the next day that went away after I had some dinner.

After getting home, I felt slighy naseous.  On a scale of 1-10, maybe like 1.5.  Was able to go about my day and eat and drink.  At 5 pm I was very tired and took a light nap. Arm was a bit sore but flu shot hurt my arm much worse.  That night I had terrible nightmares and increased heart rate, but otherwise was ok.

Next day, I had a very sore arm and the mild nasusea.  Was able to go about my day but needed another afternoon nap.  That night, my arm was hot, I developed a large black and blue at the injection site and had even worse nightmares but otherwise able to go back to bed.

By Sunday I was fine.  No nasusea, arm pain or nightmares.  My arm looks like I got a black eye, lol but no pain.

I have pretty bad seasonal allergies that have been ramping up the last 3 weeks (I‚Äôm in Minnesota). Symptoms include itchy eyes, post nasal drip/ sore throat, increased severity of oral allergy syndrome with trigger foods, and occasionally hives. These have been pretty bad this week, but I didn‚Äôt initially think that these could‚Äôve been related to the covid vaccine, however, I‚Äôm wondering if my immune system is just overwhelmed right now with allergies and trying to build antibodies.

On night 5 I woke up feeling as if I couldn't fully expand my lungs and breathe correctly with a slight dry cough that felt a bit suffocating. I woke up afterwards still feeling as if I had someone pressing on my chest and my dry cough had now become extremely desperate and shook my entire body.

PpppppI spent that entire day in bed with an ongoing ,headache.

Day 7 I woke up much better but so tired and nauseous for about the next few days. Now I'm still tired with bouts of nausea but now am having HORRIBLE diarrhea......and this is only from my first shot so I'm not sure how much worse it can get with the 2nd

And I would still do it again because it that was what covid was like but for the entire 2 weeks with no break my god I would just give up. I have my 2nd shot on April 21sf and now I know what things I need to have to make this one go smoothly

I woke up on the floor with a bump on my forehead. This has never happened to me before. The pain kept me awake about an hour, and woke me up two more times in the night. I had chills and sweats. I don't have a thermometer but must have had a fever. Pain so intense and all over, I wanted to not be in my body anymore. The next day I felt exhausted but I steadily improved. Motor function in my hands was bad, I guess from swollen joints. I kept dropping/breaking things. By evening, I was almost completely fine, just a little tired.

It bothers me that I can not find any information about similar reactions, and I can't figure out anywhere to report my symptoms.

Its about 5hrs in and I don't really feel much, a lil soreness in my arm, and I THINK im starting to get some achyness, but then again my body might just be broken lol.

I plan on putting myself in an edibles coma so I sleep heavy through the night. 

Will report how that goes.

930pm: took 2000mg full spectrum oil tincture

10:30 injection sight soreness is noticeable, but not bad or incapacitating. I had tried moving my arms above my head and massaged my muscle as I read recommendations online.

1132pm: im going to bed, still feel alright.  Let's hope this works lol

Update:

10am: was able to wake up and get out of bed, my body was really achy, felt like a hangover (I did have a few celebratory drinks of whiskey), was fatigued, but other than that i felt fine.

Took it pretty easy during the day, by the evening I wasn't nearly as sore. 

9pm: Took another 1000mg sip of tincture
10pm: went to bed

1pm (48hrs in): I feel pretty good, not 100% more like 95%.


All in all this wasn't a bad experience, the edibles definitely helped me from wanting to smoke. Would recommend.",2021-04-15 09:22:35

However, what was clearly vaccine related is how I feel this morning. Exhausted. A little achy, in a way I felt achy the day after the vaccine. I did also have two glasses of wine after working out, so that may have been a factor. Either way, my body is clearly still goin through it.

Comment,1,gug94vm,,0,1618401276.0,"First dose - 27F

Wasn‚Äôt expecting much this dose as I‚Äôm one of the last in my area of hospital to get the vaccine and 99% people seemed to have only complained of a sore arm.

Had my shot 11am, arm hurt within 20 min. 6-7hrs later felt a bit ‚Äúoff‚Äù and fever sensation started (don‚Äôt own a thermometer).
That night I tried to go to sleep early but hello insomnia. 5 hours of tossing turning, I was a bit hot and sweaty but the insomnia was by far the worst part. Had to take something to fall asleep at 3am and called in sick for work.
24 hours post dose I felt ok, bit fatigued but 10 mins of light cleaning and I felt I was burning up. Took hours to fall asleep that night again.
48 hours post dose I woke up feeling ok but once I was at work and walking around/talking I was incredibly fatigued, slow, mild nausea, headache, felt like I was burning up. Took something to help me sleep last night.
72 hours post dose: again woke up feeling alright today but once at work felt the same as the day before but now muscle/body aches and pain, headache was worse, moderate photophobia, and brain fog. Went home from work early.

I only weigh 45kg with little muscle mass, the only others who have reacted this bad in my workplace are the smaller ones (but only on second dose).

A lot of people I know usually experience the unpleasant side effects on the 2nd shot, while some are like me and feel it the first time. Also there are people like my girlfriend who didn‚Äôt feel a damn thing from both shots (maybe slight fatigue but that‚Äôs it).

Comment,1,gv14dl7,,0,1618822937.0,"So I got my first dose on the 27th of March.
After getting my first dose, in the first fifteen minutes I felt a bit of ""heavyness"" in my arm.
Later that day, a little pain at the location of the vaccine, like taking a punch. That feeling consisted for like two days, then passes.

   On 17th of April I got my second dose.
Boy, let me tell you the journey.
During the day everything was normal, a bit of pain in the arm, nothing serious.
At night, after like 2 hours of sleep, I woke up.
 I felt extreme pain in my entire body. And my body simply felt...uncomfortable, as to say. I had fever and chills at the same time. The best way to describe it : like burning in fire while dying of coldness. My breathing was heavy, sweating everywhere. I felt like I was about to die. That night I slept a maximum of 1 hour.

 The morning after vaccination.
Due to lack of sleep, at 8 in the morning I fell asleep for about half an hour then woke up again.
Extreme pain in my body, especially my arm. My head was also in pain, I felt dizzy, I couldn't focus on anything, fever, chills. I was rolling everywhere in my bed. It was painful.
 I took an aspirin and tried to play some games to take my mind away.
A few hours later, my body still felt a bit uncomfortable but it was bearable.
 
Right now it's 4 in the morning, Monday, 19th of March.
I have a bit of pain in my arm but my body feels nornal.
These are my experiences with the doses.

Pfizer 1st Dose: 3/18, sore arm. A little foggy, nothing bad until 3 weeks later when my menstrual cycle was delayed by a week (I‚Äôm never late), and that week brought on some hellacious PMS symptoms. When it did come, my cramps were worse than they‚Äôve been in years. 

Pfizer 2nd Dose: 4/16. About 6 hours in, I got a little foggy and my arm got pretty sore. I drank two beers with fully vaccinated friends, took some ibuprofen, then went to sleep for the night. Woke up around 3 AM with some night sweats, but nothing too terrible. When I woke up for the day, my head was very foggy, mild headache, and feeling tired, and my arm felt like lead ‚Äî but no body aches, didn‚Äôt feel feverish or warm. Just took ibuprofen throughout the day and felt fine, just sluggish, and then some lethargy and fatigue hit around 4 PM. Went away after a few hours, took an AdvilPM and slept really well.

Hoping that‚Äôs the worst of it but will update if needed.

Day 2 - arm soreness, no additional issues. Was able to get through my normal workout and add some extra  activity to the end with no problem.

Day 4 - arm soreness nearly gone, waves of nausea occasionally (if it‚Äôs related) but otherwise feeling great

Day 5 - fairly sure the nausea waves are related...dry mouth for past couple of days. No matter how much water I drink I can‚Äôt make it go away! Ugh

Day 6 - Nausea decreasing, ok overall but exhausted by 8pm

Day 7 - Great workout during the day but super sleepy (unusual) by 7pm. 

Day 8 - Tired. Started usual workout routine and got hit by a truck. Fatigue, headache, nausea, excessive sweat, strong desire to lay down immediately for 4-5 hours. Sat down, took something for the headache and nausea and got myself to push through. Still tired and sleepy throughout the evening.


Day 10 - Nausea gone, fatigue gone, headache gone....hoping this lasts !

Days 10-14 (and beyond) - No issues.

SHOT #2

Day 1 - arm less sore than first dose, no other symptoms until NIGHT. Chills and tired restlessness all night long.

Day 2 - fatigue, general unpleasant feeling, nothing super major though 

Day 3-5 - still some lingering fatigue, nothing else

Comment,3,gusf8vn,,0,1618649004.0,"It‚Äôs likely due to the fact that mRNA vaccines are more potent than traditional vector-based vaccines. This explains their effectivity too. We‚Äôre asking our cells to make a single viral protein and then presenting A LOT of ONLY that protein for our immune cells to see. This makes them go crazy in the response (a good thing) and thus makes us feel like crap. Now to compare that with a traditional vaccine. In the vector-based vaccines, there‚Äôs usually more than just viral protein that your immune cells will see (dilutes the immune response, not necessarily a bad thing but is less potent) and the AMOUNT of viral protein is less than that of an mRNA vaccine. This is because our cells use the mRNA to make the protein, which can happen more than once before cells destroy it (analogy: you can refill a plastic water bottle more than once, but eventually you‚Äôll probably throw it away). So the ‚Äúwhy do we feel like crap‚Äù question is most likely because of this - it‚Äôs just more potent... which makes it an efficacious vaccine.",2021-04-17 11:43:24

I think it‚Äôs great that they are out there and people are taking them to help grow the herd immunity but at the end of the day it‚Äôs my body and my choice what goes into it. I know people who have had far more severe side effects from the second dose than the effects of actually having COVID, which certainly gives me pause. Getting COVID is certainly still a risk but having one dose significantly reduces that risk and to add another 10% of protection compared to the 66% percent certainly of negative side effects from the 2nd dose really doesn‚Äôt seem worth it.

Comment,1,guqfl5d,,0,1618615508.0,"4/16/21 update - I got the second vaccine almost 2 weeks ago. The day after the 2nd dose I was doing yard work, painting, all with a slight headache. Other than that, I felt like I could take on the world.

 I've had some acid reflux and gi issues but I think they're unrelated.....if they persist through the weekend, imma hit up my MD.

the first dose railed me for 6 days, after that I felt normal. 

The second dose was easy. Maybe I had COVID and never knew it? Who knows though, unfortunately, no way of knowing now!",2021-04-17 02:25:08

Comment,1,gum1nbq,,0,1618528046.0,"My vaccine experience:

first dose: March 22. Felt fine the first 2 days and woke up in the middle of the night on the 3rd day with nosebleed. Had 4-5 episodes of nosebleeds in a day. Went to urgent care and the doctor said it‚Äôs allergies üôÑ. I do get mild nosebleeds when I take Zyrtec, but hadn‚Äôt take any as my allergies start in may. I was hesitant to take the second shot, but the doctor said to take it as I have a history of nosebleeds. I also experienced major fatigue from days 3-7.   
I think the nosebleed had to do something with the vaccine....

second dose: April 13. Took the shot at 1 pm and felt perfectly fine until 9 pm and the body pain kicked in. April 14- had to nap every 3-4 hours due to fatigue and body ache. Starting running low grade fever around 5 pm, but did not take any Tylenol. By 2 am in the morning, I was feeling great. Woke up this am feeling good, but then felt a sudden drop in sugar and fainted. Again,  not sure if it has anything to do with vaccine or not, but I have been super stressed about getting the second shot after my first shot experience. Not sure if I should go to urgent care as I think they will say that you have passed out a couple times in your lifetime, it has nothing to do with the vaccine.

24/03/2021: First dose
Sore arm for 24 hours. Nothing else

14/03/2021: Second Dose
Nothing except dead arm around 4 hours post vaccine. Diarrhea around 6 hours post vaccine. Took Imodium and 2 paracetamol and slept through the night.

Woke up 16 hours post vaccine. Achey body and muscles, like really bad post gym DOMS. Took paracetamol again. Went to work and powered through. Felt fatigued and foggy in my head. 20 hours post vaccine, aches got worse. Went to nurse in my school to get more paracetamol. She took my temperature and it was 38.4 (around 102/3 I think!) Took more paracetamol and went home. Currently 24hours post vaccine and in bed with hot water bottle. Only managed to eat a slice of toast all day. 

I am rarely sick so this is a weird one for me. Honestly don't think I've ever had a fever. Gonna try and sleep for a while and hopefully begin to feel better!

Comment,2,gv5p3tk,,0,1618885594.0,"So the arm tingling stopped, but that same night  I posted that comment 6 days ago I had a searing pain from my clavicle up my neck and into my face. Then my cheek went numb. Felt like when you go to the dentist and they numb you for a procedure. I went to the ER (now my second trip) and they checked for stroke (I didn‚Äôt have one). They wanted to admit me for observation to be seen by a neurologist and further testing but after being there for 8 hours alone in a room I got really anxious and asked for a referral to outpatient. If I would have known that it would be 2 months before I could get in to see a neurologist outpatient I would have stayed there!

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at on day 8: the facial numbness faded. I have brain fog and a dull ache that travels around. Yesterday it was in my left shoulder blade, today it‚Äôs in my left clavicle (where the searing pain was). I also have random stabbing pains throughout my body. It feels like someone is poking me really hard and then it goes away after about 5 seconds. Happens all over and almost never in the same place twice.

I hope it all goes away soon. I was able to make an appointment with an Internist for Thursday to start figuring out these random pains. I decided I will not be opting in to the second shot, or at least until someone can figure out what‚Äôs wrong with me.

Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine Obsevations,67,l96w0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/l96w0h/pfizerbiontech_vaccine_obsevations/,105,1612104893.0,"I (44/M) was inoculated around 6:45 in the evening on Wednesday, Jan. 27 with the Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine. I received the vaccine at a mass inoculation site at our local Expo Center. I am technically part of the 1b group, but was able to get the shot at the tail end of the 1a group, due to some wrangling by my employer.

I experienced some dizziness and splitting headache about 10 minutes after the injection (in right deltoid) and mild pain at injection site, while I was waiting in the 15 minute observation waiting area after the shot was given. On the 28th, I felt some nausea and dizziness again about 14 hours later and another bad headache. The nausea and dizziness dissipated shortly and the headache later in the afternoon. The injection site was slightly more painful. On Friday, 29th and Saturday, 30th, basically no symptoms. Counting my blessings.

Why I choose to get shot?

1) Health Concerns. I have some underlying conditions (Asthma, Hypertension and a few others).

2) Opportunity. I put my name in early with employer, got the call, drove to the site.

3) Research. If you read the trial data on the vaccine BNT162b2 it was 95% effective against COVID-19, 7 days after the 2nd dose: https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577?articleTools=true

What makes me apprehensive about this shot?

1) We do not know the long term side effects of the vaccine. Should I wait until this is determined?

2) Rabies, Influenza, Cytomegalovirus, and Zika have all had vaccines created with mRNA (all of which I have not had), yet the #1 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and #2 (modeRNA) vaccines use this new delivery system of mRNA for vaccination. Is mRNA truly safe for humans? 

3) The trial lasted 111 days (July 27 to Nov 14, 2020), so does that mean the vaccine was created in 4 months 17 days (139 days) minus the initial testing on humans, if you use the day of March 11 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this a pandemic? My memory tells me Dr. Anthony Fauci on many press conferences, said it would take a year to a year and a half to create a vaccine, yet Pfizer-BioNTech did it just under 5 months and also created a vaccine with a 95% efficacy. It almost seems to good to be true? 

4) LNP (Lipid Nanoparticles) is such a new technology in medicine, relatively speaking, it is also worrisome the effects this will have on our bodies with this vaccine?

5) Why is there such a heavy push to get vaccinated by the media and political affiliations? And why all of a sudden IS THIS vaccine free to anyone, but other vaccines are not? Who is paying for all of this?

6) If I wait until the summer when it is rolled out, will there still be enough available? Will there be a syringe shortage, as some are talking about? Will there be some other issue that arises, that I will not be able to get the shot, when the opportunity to get it is now?

Finally, some observations about the evening I received my shot:

1) There were some 40 booths set up, one after the other at my site, giving out the vaccines. It was not very private or HIPPA regulated, as one would normally see in a hospital setting and maybe this is because the government (ie. tax payer) is on the hook for the shots and privacy is not a concerned.

2) The nurse giving me the shot was (to my understanding) not a licensed nurse but a student nurse from the local university...not sure if this matters or not? My muscle of my arm had some spasms as it was being injected by her.

3) Before I got my shot, I had to wait a few minutes for it to be drawn up. The problem with this was, I had no idea what was injected in me, as I never saw the vial the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù was drawn out of. It was very much like the scene at the end of ‚ÄúThe Wizard of Oz‚Äù, when the wizard came out from behind the curtain; a different nurse came from behind me through these make-shift booth curtains to hand the student nurse a syringe. I asked to see the syringe for any information on it, but all it had on it was a lot #. The nurse said to me, ‚Äúthis is your last chance to back out.‚Äù In conversation with her prior while I was waiting, she had told me she had yet to get the vaccine, but it was offered to her as part of the nursing program. She was still undecided to get hers.

4) As I was rushed to the booth, I was handed a 6 page document about the vaccine, that I did not really get to read until I got home later. Maybe it was my naivety about the vaccine, but I did not realize the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was not approved by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) but rather fell under an EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) by the FDA. Under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), the FDA Commissioner may allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by CBRN threat agents when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. READ EVERYTHING YOU ARE HANDED BEFORE YOU TAKE THE VACCINE, SO YOU CAN MAKE THE BEST INFORMED DECISION. I might have waited on getting it, had I known this little snippet about it, regardless of the claimed 95% efficacy.

I will update my post, if I experience any more symptoms. 

I am scheduled Feb. 17 for Dose #2. Am praying this was the right decision, despite my objections above.

Good Luck to those thinking about this difficult decision themselves and their families. It was not an easy one for me, even despite having already gotten the vaccine.",2021-01-31 16:54:53
Delayed Symptoms From 1st Dose 5 Days Later,81,l8skoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/l8skoz/delayed_symptoms_from_1st_dose_5_days_later/,147,1612061387.0,"I thought I would share my experience with the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine in case it's more common than I think. I had gotten it last week on Thursday (Jan 21st) and the only early-on symptom I had that I could confirm was from the vaccine was arm soreness at the injection site which was mostly just the day after and really not bad.

Fast forward to Tuesday, I started having really bad chills for a couple of hours while out eating with my Fiance, and checked my temperature when I got home and I was 99.1 (after drinking water so probably actually higher). My temperature stayed in that range for 2 days (Tues and Weds) along with the chills and I clocked it as high as 99.5 when intentionally avoiding water for 30+ minutes to get an accurate reading (yes, I hydrate a LOT). I also had bad chest pain, likely from muscle aches and tightness, and I was pretty convinced I had contacted COVID from my Fiance's coworker who tested positive a couple days prior.

My Fiance and I got tested and both came back negative so I can only assume this was a very delayed reaction to the vaccine, but I felt mostly better by Wednesday so all in all it just lasted about 2 days.",2021-01-31 04:49:47

i got my second dose of the pfizer vaccine on tuesday, and for the most part felt fine the next day.  even the arm soreness was diminished from the first shot.  last night, however, approximately 30 hours after the shot, i decided to have a snack of chips and salsa.  these were left over from a meal the night before in which i had eaten a ton of both without any problem.  

only three dipped chips into my snack, my tongue started burning SEVERELY.  felt like my mouth was on fire.  i have a very high tolerance for spicy food and this was just some jalapeno based salsa that, as i mentioned, i had a lot of the night before and, if anything, was disappointed with how mild it was.  not so the next night.  my face turned red, my eyes were tearing, and no matter what i tried to do to ease the burn - bread, milk, ice cream - it lasted for nearly 30 minutes.  never experienced anything like that, and i eat habaneros, ghost peppers, etc, whenever i have the opportunity.

the only thing that could have done this is a reaction to the vaccine.  i did some research on capsaicin-induced mouth burn as a possible immune response and couldn't find anything but mentions of spicy food as being good for strengthening the immune system, but that's about it.  it was so weird.  i want to try it again tonight to see if the same thing will happen, but i honestly don't want to go through that again.

anyone heard of this or a physiological mechanism to explain it?  i had a bunch of co-workers who got the second dose today, so i have asked them to try tasting some salsa tomorrow in a mini experiment.  i'll report back if others notice the same effect or i am an isolated case...",2021-01-29 09:56:53

I received my first dose on 1/20, and today is 1/24. 

\-On the 20th, my arm felt pretty sore by the end of the day, but when I woke up I didn't feel any soreness. I felt a little out of breath for the few hours after my vaccine. 

\-The past few days I have felt really tired, but I'm not sure if it's due to the vaccine or just general stress. I also started having stomach issues today - nausea, etc. I'm also not sure if this is due to the vaccine.

Second dose,49,kx253z,https://www.reddit.com/r/PfizerVaccine/comments/kx253z/second_dose/,56,1610644033.0,"*UPDATE - I survived. Last night was rough, but this morning I was fine (other than being exhausted from lack of sleep and a sore arm from the injection site). My supervisor had the opposite experience; she was fine all day yesterday but had to go home within two hours of being at work due to fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Our program director experienced these side effects after her first dose, but nothing after her second. My advice: try to schedule the shots on days when you are able to rest afterward and the following day; it seems like side effects vary but it would be safer to give yourself some time to recuperate :)

I just received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine this afternoon at 3:30pm. I felt fine immediately after, and figured I would have a pretty uneventful experience like I did the first time around (had no side effects except for a sore arm the next day). At around 7pm, I started to get a headache that got progressively worse. I laid down for a bit and fell asleep, only to wake up a few hours later with a headache, strong cramps similar to period cramps, and a low grade fever (99.1 temp). I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience so far, or if they had to miss work from side effects of the second dose? I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll be able to sleep it off and be back to normal 8 hours from now when I leave for work.",2021-01-14 19:07:13
Comment,1,h6b4gq9,,0,1627083613.0,"Thanks for the reply. Yeah I still feel sick, kind of like I‚Äôve catched a cold. Super curious if it is because of the vaccine or just like in general (but technically it is way too warm for that).

Guess I‚Äôll try to relax on the weekend.

Thanks for the idea with the Fitbit. Maybe I will actually get something like an Apple Watch since these can also do EKG and track everything. Indeed for me it‚Äôs usually concerns about the heart mainly.

But again I can‚Äôt do much other than wait and see what my body does. Relaxing it‚Äôs actually hard with an anxiety disorder as you probably can relate. Hope you have a great weekend though.",2021-07-24 02:40:13

Also had a full headache.
I had to do home schooling with my youngest so just alternated between panadol and nurofen the whole day and got through it.

Next day felt fine.

Now Friday and still feel ok.

Also I forgot to mention, 5 mins after getting the second shot, I had a strange metallic taste in my mouth and slight numb tongue. Started to freak out a little and get the sweats.

Comment,1,h626x0u,,0,1626907641.0,"First of all I appreciate your post a lot. As someone with mental issues and anxiety myself, I know how fucking hard it is to know what it‚Äôs real and what is just your mind playing with you. 

I‚Äôve received my first Dosis last Friday and at first not much hapernd. Not even sore muscles or anything. I‚Äôve went on with my day as per usual. I‚Äôve felt fairly fit and even did some light sports the next day. But then I‚Äôm the afternoon first signs hit me that something feels weird. It felt like I had issues breathing. I had issues sleeping that day because anxiety kicked into overdrive. On Sunday it was somewhat okay but again issues in the evening with breathing. On Monday it was just bad and I went to the doctor, but they‚Äôve just said to check back in when I‚Äôd feel worse. On Tuesday I had a really big panic attack after work (totally what I needed at that time, not) and on Wednesday I‚Äôve first decided to go to work but wasn‚Äôt able. I knew a lot might be from my anxiety but still was worried. So then they‚Äôve also checked everything with me, checked my breathing, did an EKG and even checked if I had issues with my heart by doing a drop test (never heard of it before).

As someone who is roughly in your age range I totally get where you‚Äôre coming from and know just how badly your mind can fuck over your body and give you false alarms and wrong symptoms.

Still I will get my second shot even though I know I will probably feel bad again. Please do the update when you‚Äôve had your second shot and let me know what might be happening to me as well (since we have had nearly the same symptoms).

Comment,1,h5lrebd,,0,1626590889.0,"My experience as a generally healthy person with rock solid immunity, 30 F, with no prominent pre-existing conditions, and never caught Covid:

First dose of Pfizer was effortless with only fatigue and arm soreness, though period has been more painful than my usual naturally painless cycles. 

Got my 2nd Pfizer on the morning of July 12. Fatigue during the day and nausea (up to 150 bpm) in the evening. Went to the ER at 2am due to crazy palpitations and numbness waves/paresthesia in face, upper body and arms (mostly arms). Major anxiety brought on by it, and a few twinges of heart pain. I know this was all side effects as I've never had a panic attack. Multiple test results came back clear but was given a potassium supplement which helped.

The waves of numbness/tingling/palps come and go along with confusion, anxiety, lightheadedness, brain fog, usually occurring at night. On July 13, I couldn't sleep all night due to the numbness waves, but palps were less intense. Limbs twitched a bit while trying to fall asleep, started lucid dreaming and heard a few split seconds' worth of ""voices"". I know this is not normal for me. Felt better during the day with about 5 seconds of a mild burning sensation on thigh.

July 14 was less severe with redness near injection area, fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath and mild palpitations on and off, starting in the evening (seems pretty common). I try to get some safe sunlight exposure during the day in hopes of regulating my nervous system/circadian rhythm.

July 15 was much better, with only a bit of fatigue, mild nausea during the day, and mild palps and barely noticeable numbness waves in the evening. 

July 16/17 - mild heart pains, fatigue and palps on and off in the late afternoon, and especially when lying down to sleep. Seems to slowly be fading.

July 18 - Some fatigue and palps during the day. The heart pains and intermittent numb waves seem to mostly happen when I lie down and try to sleep, though also shortly during the evening.

Planning to ride it out for the next few weeks, then get checked out if necessary.

One interesting thing to note is that my small patch of eczema has mostly neutralized in just 2-3 days, after 2 years. Period is regular for the most part, but has been way more painful after the 1st and 2nd jabs after a year of naturally painless cramps.

Comment,2,h58k9hf,,0,1626322105.0,"‚Ä¢26F - active lifestyle + healthy diet - no known health issues, but heart problems run in my family 

‚Ä¢Diagnosed and medicated for anxiety (as needed) and ADHD (daily)

‚Ä¢1st shot received June 24th, 2nd scheduled for July 23rd - will update again after then. 

My experience:

I canceled my first appointment due to anxiety. I was initially supposed to receive Moderna, but I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt as an allergy of mine puts me at higher risk of side effects - from Moderna, specifically. Weird. 

No healthcare practitioner or nurse told me this despite the fact I informed them of my allergy - I only learnt it through the general literature provided while waiting in line for Pfizer. Also weird! 

After getting my dose, I felt fine aside from two minutes of a hotflash. I left the clinic, ran a few errands without issue (aside from an gradually increasing soreness in my arm) and got home just in time to be hit with a wave of fatigue. 

My Internet was being installed, and I nearly fell asleep while the techs were around (lol) - they left, and I immediately went to bed, sleeping for nearly 12 hours straight. This is kind of a big deal as I normally take sleeping pills - I did not need them this day as staying awake was more of a struggle than falling asleep. 

The next day I woke up with a supremely sore arm and foggy brain. Went about my day as planned, and ended up getting in my very first car accident (woo!) - no serious harm was done to either of us or our cars, luckily. 

The fogginess and intermittent disassociation continued for over a week, but my arm began to improve on the 3rd day. I was back in the gym within 72 hours. 

On the 4th day, I began to feel extremely faint on top of the disassociation and perceived heart palpitations. I say ‚Äúperceived‚Äù due to my anxiety disorder (the brain is a very powerful thing) and the fact that I noticed them post workout, after taking preworkout and my ADHD medication - double stimulants. 

In a panic, I took myself to the ER, sat through blood work, an EKG, etc. and was told by the doctor that he wished his vitals were as good as mine (lol I guess) then sent on my way. 

My period was a few days late, but that could be entirely unrelated. As mentioned, I‚Äôll update after my second dose‚Ä¶ or if I have anything else worth sharing. 

TLDR: experienced fogginess, intermittent disassociation, perceived heart palpitations, and sore arm.

The entire world shut down which had massive economic impacts.  So on a rare occasion, the non forced staggered testing of things that might take the world out of it was accepted. There are a numbers of western jabs which are being used. People have the jabs because they want this to end, and also because lack of coughing and what not means less spread. It is not a cure.

We're only concerned about people dying, they're concerned about the cash.

I want to share my side effects story, as i stand sitting on my bed at 3 am in the morning, after a visit to the emergency. I got my first shot on june 24, and had common side effects like arm pain and headache. 4 days after the shot, i had a panic attack and went to emergency. All kind of tests they made were pretty good, regular ecg and perfect pressure, oxygenation and blood analysis were all good, not a single anomaly. But i keep feeling those side effects like temporary paresthesia. The first minute after the vaccine injection, i felt se kind of burning inside my throat, and head dizziness. They kept me under observation for two hours, my eyes were burning and i had increased heart rate. Expecially this eye related fact has kept me company since the first shot, although it goes away sometimes and then comes back. My bigges fear is that some blood cloth will form somewhete, but i never had blood troubles, and  neither in my family anyone was affected by trombosys or something like that, maybe this is just a psychological factor like all doctors said, in fact the first time i went to emergency they gave me something to treat stress and sode effects went away, but i am very surprised that my body will go dumb on its own just for a psychological factor. I should take my second shot next week but i have some fear of heavier side effects, and since i am far from home for work stuff, i am alone in a hotel room and will stay here for at least two months.

She ran an EKG which was normal. Wouldn't you know there were no palpitations while the machine was running? But she said my resting heart rate was faster than normal, and my blood pressure's a little higher than normal. But not alarmingly so. What I neglected to tell her was that when I exert myself just a little, like climbing a flight of stairs, my heart starts pounding.

Woke up the next morning with a headache and feeling pretty fatigued. Spent the day on the couch with not much relief from the headache and fatigue, and also getting sweaty on and off throughout the day. Insomnia persisted that night.

The morning after that (2nd day after the jab) I still felt a little off - tired, headache and on/off sweats.

Here it is 7 days later. Majority of the side effects are gone. I still have diarrhea when I go poop. I do get hot easily and feel naseaus at times.

HOWEVER. The stomach pain has been going for 7 days straight. 168 hours. Non stop. Some days are unbearable. Others are bearable but annoying. It honestly feels like I have a stomach virus or a parasite trying to eat my stomach from the inside.

I do get cramps in the lower left and lower right abdomen. But the consistent pain is right in the middle under my ribs. I've tried BRAT diet, sitting up, ginger, staying hydrated, Tylenol, stomach pain pills, PPIs, Sleep. Nothing seems to be working.

Comment,1,h25p8gw,,0,1623978163.0,"Have you ever sat around thinking to yourself, ‚Äúman, I really have been feeling too healthy lately. I want to make sure I feel like absolute death. I want parts of my soul to rip away as I‚Äôm alternatively sweating and shivering in an effort to prevent myself from getting sick later...kind of...‚Äù? Then this vaccine is for you! 

Your first little does of medicinal question marks in the form of a needle may or may not cause side effects. Since I hit the jackpot, I got to taste those. Starts with area soreness at the site, and I don‚Äôt know if maybe I just upset the pharmacist but definitely more painful then your typical needle. Otherwise it‚Äôs just a warning of what is to come. That‚Äôs right, you get to know, 3 weeks in advance, that if you do something you will feel like üí© and then you go ahead and do the thing. Which I think is a new form of insanity.

But I digress. The second shot has been a freight train of death hitting me since around 430am. You ever wake up and low crawl to a bath to start your day with a unique blend of sophistication and embarrassment? Well check that off my bucket list. Since then I‚Äôve napped twice. Napped may be a misnomer, one such nap lasted 5 hours. Because being numb to the pain of my body slowly rotting into a corpse seems much better than being alert. All I want is a drink, but I‚Äôm 100% positive if my feet touch the floor I will freeze to death.

6/5 stars, would definitely recommend to all my loved ones.",2021-06-18 04:02:43

Got my first dose on friday. I felt great until about 24 hours from taking the shot. I woke up from an afternoon nap feeling incredibly weak, hot and nauseous, still no fever. I thought to myself I‚Äôll just rest and that‚Äôs it it‚Äôll go away in a few hours but soon after I got the chills and my body temperature shot up really fast so the day turned into a cycle of taking ibuprofen and laying in bed. The next day was more of the same really, I tried doing stuff around the house but my headache was killing me and I was tired as I‚Äôve ever been. Fast forward to the evening my fever decreased without any medication and I felt some relief thinking this is finally over... but wait, there‚Äôs more! I was woken up a few hours ago in the middle of the night by diarrhea and a slight fever hah, but at least I don‚Äôt feel as tired anymore.

UPDATE (6/12, 8:50am): arm sore at injection site but not unbearable. I could still sleep on my side. Some indigestion last night but I blame it on the beer and pizza :). More updates later today.

UPDATE (6/12, 11pm): arm still only slightly sore. A small headache, but it feels like the typical tension headaches I get from time to time. Had body aches earlier and felt weak, but had a nap and felt fine after. Bed time now and will report back tomorrow!

Comment,1,h0wwxoa,,0,1623077128.0,Yup.

Comment,1,h0kd2p4,,0,1622813469.0,"I had the second Pfizer shot about a month ago. I have separated my shoulders several times throughout my lifetime and was just starting to have a bit of arthritis pain in both, occasionally.
A couple of days after the shot, I started having terrible pain in both shoulders which didn't subside. 
I couldn't even lift my arms to take my shirt without being in pain. Trying to sleep was impossible.
My primary care doc said to wait 20 days out from the shot and she'd then prescribe an oral steroid (prednisone) and an anti inflammatory.
That combo worked after a couple days, but the pain came back just as strong about a week after my last dose of prednisone.
Next up were cortisone injections directly into the joints...worked after a couple days and then the pain was back to full intensity about 10 days later.
I'm going to see a pain specialist next to see if medical marijuana might help.
This ""free"" life saving vaccine is running up quite a bill - even with health insurance.

About 1:30am, I got up to use the toilet and felt quite dizzy. I think I passed out as I woke up sat on the toilet but hadn‚Äôt done anything, it must have been as soon as I sat down. I‚Äôd fallen forwards into a towel rail and that woke me up. 

Got up and felt awful, so went to lie on the floor. I remember a bang and thinking I‚Äôd have woken my partner up - I think I collapsed. I woke up (again) on the floor covered in sweat. Lay there for a while unable to move. 

When I finally managed to get up, I took some paracetamol and went back to bed where my fever quickly changed to chills.

I woke up this morning feeling a bit achey, arm is still sore, but fine otherwise. I think I‚Äôve had Covid before so maybe that‚Äôs why I got such a strong reaction. I just wanted to share my experience. As another commenter said, I‚Äôve been looking for people online to ‚Äúshare in my misery!‚Äù

Just wanted to share my experience.

&#x200B;

I got the second Pfizer shot on May 8. I'm < 30 years old, male, very healthy/active. Have been completely compromised, and 3 weeks later still feeling terrible. Have myocarditis/heart inflammation, and some type of inflammation response in ears/head also causing headache/dizziness.

&#x200B;

It bothers me that the CDC/Pfizer seem to minimize the severity of inflammation/dizziness that people are having. In fact I don't think ""dizziness"" is even a side effect listed on Pfizer's fact sheet. The truth is they don't fully know the effects of the substance they injected us with, which is a bit scary.",2021-05-30 01:24:09

No real symptoms or side effects. My arm hurts today. Feels like I got punched really hard in the arm, but it‚Äôs not intrusive. I‚Äôve pulled my deltoid before lifting and it‚Äôs very similar.

I‚Äôm still not quite 100%. The intense dizziness is gone but I can still feel traces of it when I move my head or when I first wake up.  

I‚Äôm back training (Les Mills cardio stuff) and still get a little vertigo afterwards but it is dissipating. However I do feel something just isn‚Äôt quite ‚Äúright‚Äù with me. It isn‚Äôt too debilitating but I know it‚Äôs there. 

I‚Äôm hopeful within a month or two though it‚Äôll be gone entirely.  I‚Äôm pretty confident it will be.

Comment,1,gz4oypu,,0,1621744575.0,"Received second dose at 10:15AM on Friday, 5/21. Injection slightly more painful than first dose - healthcare worker said they had new needles...

Started feeling lethargic at work and by the end of the work-day it was difficult to focus and I could feel a heavy sensation behind my eyes.

On the drive home, around 6:30PM, I felt lethargic, but not nauseous like with the first dose while driving home.

At approximately 9:30PM, I started feeling hot and cold (fever, I‚Äôm sure but I never measured my temperature) and my hands tingled because they were ice-cold. I went to bed about an hour later with my fianc√©. I then started shivering uncontrollably for about three minutes until my body started to warm up from being wrapped up in my comforter and fleece blanket. I was feeling like dog-sh!t at this point - aches and pains, the arm where I received the injection, ouch!!! I could feel it going up the left side of my neck. My fianc√© got me some ibuprofen and after about an hour, I was feeling slightly better and was able to go to sleep.

At 12:57AM, early this morning, I woke up and was very uncomfortable, feverish, limbs ice cold but my chest, legs, face were red-hot. I could not go back to sleep - I ended up going to the kitchen and eating some starburst which was a nice little treat for my dry, hot mouth. Downed some water and fell back asleep around 3AM.

I woke up this morning (5/22) around 10:00AM (approx 24hrs since inoculation) and I was feeling pretty normal. My arm was sore which was to be expected and I felt like I was running on about 70% battery-life.

A few hours later, I started feeling feverish again, achy, and that heavy, burning sensation behind my eyes. I could never get comfortable enough to actually nap. Felt pretty lethargic and on about 40% battery-life.

Food also tasted different throughout the day, odd that I had an appetite at all...anyway, I started feeling better about 8:30PM today, I had a surge of hunger hit me and I satisfied it and now I‚Äôm writing this.

Tips: ice-pack on injection site at night is glorious. Take some Tylenol or ibuprofen and stay hydrated and fed. Don‚Äôt move around a lot however keep using the arm you got the shot in.

I really was hesitant to get the second shot, but I did it in case I ever have to travel... and the reaction to the second shot was MUCH more, ‚Äúnormal‚Äù... just one day of feeling SUPER hungover. Then I was fine. 

So I don‚Äôt know!!! I‚Äôve heard of ppl getting sick for up to 2 weeks after the first shot with all sorts of flu like symptoms (muscle soreness, migraines, exhaustion)....

Seasonal allergies.

First shot: Tired, weak arm, sore spot on arm, sleepy at random times, 1 week in everything feels fine with minor migraines. Could not lift my table/wood I was working on. 2 wks in, I'm feeling normal but with one weird thing. My left ear went deaf for a good half of day in the week 2. Everything hears muffled one side but my right hears fine. Hearing is back to normal 2 days later.

Second report:

Got my second shot yesterday. Arm is not sore from the shot only the spot where the needle entered. I was awaiting for my side effects that are similar to the first where I was tired and weak but nothing. Eyes get droopy from reading so I took two hour nap. Woke up and felt nothing similar to the first dose. No sore arm or tiredness side effects like the first dose. Then some thing occurred after having lunch. Stomach growled nothing serious and went to use the restroom. Two hours later, Stomach gurgled and had to use the restroom again. I counted 5-6 trips to the restroom for number 2. Still no other side effects like the first. Today I had breakfast and had to go number 2 twice this morning. All solid beside one Diarrhea.  So far no other side effect.

Comment,1,gxyzsrd,,0,1620910009.0,"Hi, I took the first dose arond 1 st of May and will have the second on 21 May. 

I was scared and only agreed to take'em because I travel between 2 countries often and I need to be 'trvel-friendly'. If i stayed permanently in one place I would propably opt to take avaccine next year/see how things play out.

First day my arm (where the injection was) was painful. This went away after 10 days. First three days I had no other symptoms but on fourth to seventh day my neck glands (the ones who light up when i get sick to find illness) where a bit swollen and I felt as if my body is fighting a virus yet no fever and zero 'common cold' symptom just swolen lymphnodes at the base of my neck. That subsided and now im normal again.

Last but not least, im a bit scared of the second dose cause I hear / read online how some people died on the second dose.  Hope I dont die? heh. I just need to take care of my pooches and a few random cats, dont wanna die.

As you can tell I really am very scared of the vaccine for covid and only did it to avoid he hassles for those who travel by air or ferry and have to do constant test prior/after travel plus hotel-bound self-quarantines. But if I had the choice not to travel for family reason now-now, I would NOT do the vaccine and see how things would evolve while keeping distances and wearing a mask etc as I did so far.

What scares me most is rumors that the vaccines of certain brands (among them pfizer) are useless or even that they make one more succeptible to certain strains but I hope its just scary rumors (did not have the time/mental stamina to read on that).

also, I never had a severe anaphylaxis in my life, was never ''that type of person'' but 2 years ago I had oxygen 91 and all the signs of severe anaphylaxis which is why I didnt want to take the vaccine and why im still scared. I will update here when I have done second dose.",2021-05-13 15:46:49
Comment,2,gxxvn6m,,0,1620878371.0,"Had my first Pfizer shot 3 weeks ago. Was fine the first day except my period started, very early and unexpectedly, about 5 hours after the shot. Day two I felt like I was in a car accident and had whiplash from my shoulder to the heel of my foot but only on one side. Day 3 I had a sore arm and some body stiffness and thought I was on the mend. Day 4 I woke up with a crushing pain around my ribs, like I couldn‚Äôt catch my breath but not. Took my blood pressure and O2 Sat and they were fine so I took some Tylenol and went to sleep. Day 5 my lymph nodes in my neck and armpits were swollen and the skin over them was sore to the touch (still is sometimes). Day 6 the headaches started. Called my doc on day 7 and she refused to see me and told me to go to the ER because I had left sided (shot side) shoulder and back pain. Sat there for 8 hours and had an EKG, heart ultrasound, 2 rounds of blood tests and an X-ray checking for blood clots and heart attack. Came back clean but with very low potassium. Was told it‚Äôs probably shot side effects, my immune response was probably crazy and that they should subside. I‚Äôve had constant headaches, random dizzy spells, cold hands and feet like something is wrong with my circulation, profound fatigue all day long and terrible left side shoulder blade pain that gets worse with movement. The newest thing that started happening about 5 days ago is that my arms feel heavy. Like I have been lifting super heavy weights everyday except I never recover. It‚Äôs so tight and I can‚Äôt figure out why. I am scheduled to get shot 2 tomorrow but I don‚Äôt think I can do it. Wtf is happening to me? Has anyone else had any similar issues? Do I risk it and get the second one in hopes that I ‚Äúreset‚Äù? Or do I wait until I feel better to get it?",2021-05-13 06:59:31
Comment,2,gxxgs0m,,0,1620870310.0,"So... I just had my second dose on Sunday at 5pm.
I was already quite fatigued from finals and family time but around midnight I began to feel like I had the ‚Äúbody flu‚Äù- aches and general joint discomfort. Slept for roughly 12 hours which was honestly nice and way over due for the semester.

Monday I had an elevated temp (usually 97.8) at 99.6 F. Aside from feeling the fever and aches I woke up Tuesday as if nothing had happened.

I can‚Äôt 100% claim my tiredness is post vax effects because my period starts this week and I also take other medications that can influence my fatigue levels dependent on my hormones.

Arm pain with first dose was actually way more uncomfortable than the second. I didn‚Äôt feel the first injection when it happened, but the second one felt like a nerve got hit... like a light shock, but not unbearable.

I am physically very sensitive and feel unwell easily but the vaccine was ALOT easier than I initially anticipated.
All in all I‚Äôm grateful I was able to get the vaccine and Pfizer has a good track record (medically speaking) stay hydrated and plan to get the second one with a day or two off work.

Shot 1: Tiredness that began half an hour later, took a nap 4 hours after and woke up with noticeable elevated body temp that went away within the next hour. Had slight brain fog first day too. Tiredness lasted through the next day. Overall didn‚Äôt feel too bad at all.

I have severe health anxiety. I had a full blown panic attack when I got my 1st shot (2nd shot is in 2 more weeks). But, after 14 years of therapy I am finally able to recognize when I'm panicking. I was worried about getting dizzy, and lo and behold,I was dizzy and lightheaded BEFORE getting the shot! So I got the shot, waited 30 mins, drank a ton of water and ate a Granola bar. The panic attack calmed down about 10-20 mins after the shot and all was well. My anxiety has been heightened this week, but I blame that on finals and lack of sleep. 
I have a whole post on my experience to help out others who are nervous prior to their shot. It's nice to hear others reassuring fellow anxiety sufferers that yes, the anxiety is valid but it's JUST anxiety and ""it too will pass"".",2021-05-10 06:39:00

Comment,1,gxj0v8q,,0,1620588400.0,"Guess I'll share my experience, as someone who just had their second dose yesterday. I'm a 19 year old female, with a history of chronic headaches. 

First dose: Mild arm pain began a couple hours after the shot. As the day went on, I had a mild headache (3/10). The pain responded better to Tylenol than ibuprofen. Woke up the next day with a mild headache (2/10), mild pain around injection, and tired. All of the symptoms were eased through Excedrin Migraine. Symptoms dissipated within a week. Menstrual flow was normal. 

Second dose: Mild arm pain began around an hour after the shot. As the day went on, there was a mild tension headache (3/10) and moderate fatigued. It was mildly soothed through Tylenol. I woke up a couple hours after falling asleep to body aches (4/10) and a mild sore throat (1/10), and had a difficult time sleeping. Eventually fell asleep and woke up a couple hours later with a mild headache (2/10), injection site pain (2/10) body aches, joint pain, and fatigue. With Excedrin migraine (I might have grown a tolerance to ibuprofen), symptoms dissipated and was able to go back to lightly active day.

Comment,1,gx91qk5,,0,1620375097.0,"Hey folks. Just for data purposes - I got the Pfizer vaccine 10 days ago. I didn‚Äôt want it as I‚Äôm very particular about what I put in my body. However I did the ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù thing and cracked on. I also wanted to test it on behalf of my wife and daughters. 

I was absolutely fine post jab. Other than a dead arm no symptoms at all. Continued to train and felt fine. However a few days ago I woke up with vertigo. It was brutal on the first day. Felt drunk but not sick or nauseous at all. However the dizziness was debilitating. Had to lie down all day. 

Also, using a phone for example is hellish. A few minutes looking at the screen and it feels like I‚Äôve been on a rollercoaster. 

Three days later and I‚Äôm still dizzy. It‚Äôs not as bad but it‚Äôs very slow progress. I‚Äôll report back in a week and update my progress for anyone who is interested.

Sorry, just having a bit of fun with you. You're right, though.

Comment,1,gx8u9fi,,0,1620368550.0,"Twice I tried to post a question on this community, but it didn't work, so I'll just leave this here. After the 2nd shot, about 30-36 hours in, I developed a baseball sized spot on my arm about an inch below the injection site. It was hot to touch, slightly swollen, painful and tender, and red like a sunburn. After some research, it sounds like ""covid arm"", and through my conversation with my doctor's office over the phone, that's what they think as well. It continued to get worse until about 50 hours after the 2nd shot and has since been steadily getting better. Apparently ""covid arm"" isn't super common, but my understanding is it's essentially harmless and is just a reaction to the mounting response for your immune system and will resolve on its own in a few days. 

My experience is a bit of an outlier, since it seems like most incidents of ""covid arm"" occur after the first shot and delayed (like 8 days later according the to few sources I found online) and lasts for a few days. Mine was less than 2 days after the second shot, and seems to already be resolving. Other than this, I've had basically no side effects to either shot (no headaches, nausea, fatigue, etc.). 

I wanted to leave this info somewhere in case someone else has similar symptoms. I tend to worry easily, so it would have helped me a lot to have seen a post like this or to have been able to post my question and get responses. It would have helped to know there were documented similar cases that weren't the click-bait horror stories of clots (the symptoms of which WebMD also describes as warm, swollen, change in color, and painful üôÑ). 4am web searches are absolutely terrifying, so maybe this will help someone else not immediately rush to the fear of doom and gloom.",2021-05-07 09:22:30

Comment,1,gx8iawr,,0,1620359947.0,"Male 36. Pfizer first dose 4/15- no major side effects. The nurse went high on my arm and must have hit a blood vessel. I‚Äôve never had blood run down my arm from a shot. My arm was already getting sore within 5 minutes of sitting in the recovery chair/waiting area. I get a flu shot every year, so I‚Äôve learned over time how to stay loose enough to not get a sore arm and I was amazed at how sore my arm got and how quickly it set in. It stayed sore for about 36 hours. Sometimes the discomfort traveled into my shoulder and part of my chest. I felt a hot flash for about 30 seconds while waiting to leave. I was a little tired for the rest of the day. I had a few random weird feelings over the next several days. Not dizziness but just feeling off for a few minutes. Any oddities like that stopped within a week. I didn‚Äôt take anything for symptoms.

Second dose 5/6- so far so good.  Very little discomfort in my arm compared to the first shot. More general fatigue this time and feeling out of it so far. I‚Äôm not sure if this is mild brain fog, but it‚Äôs just a general lack of motivation to do much. It‚Äôs been 13 hours as of now. I‚Äôll update if anything noteworthy happens.

Update- I had a really vivid dream the morning after the second dose. Other than that, not much else. A few mild headaches/pressure that came and went repeatedly on day 2 and maybe a little on day 3. All that has stopped at this point. It‚Äôs 5/9 and I felt normal all day.",2021-05-07 06:59:07

I had a really difficult time completing my schoolwork, lots of trouble concentrating, screen fatigue after just a couple of hours. This is not as severe but still present.

There are stories on Reddit of people having Covid for 5 months and having to take blood thinners their whole life.  I cannot get Covid, it would be dangerous for me.  But even seemingly young and healthy people have gotten very sick with Covid and died.  So to me, risking Covid instead of getting the vaccine is like playing Russian roulette.  You are betting on the fact that A) you won't get a bad case of it and B) you won't have nasty side effects that will dog you the rest of your life.  What a terrible bet.  And plus the future variants are just going to be nastier and harder to overcome.  The sooner we stamp out the contagion the better.

The vaccine seems so much safer.  I had both doses and I'm so relieved, I can't even tell you.  I can rejoin life again soon, to some extent.  I am a tiny bit more tired at times but I'm not the least bit concerned about a small trade off like that.  I had a fever and chills for a day and a half with my second dose.  I just stayed in and slept it off and drank a lot of water and electrolytes.

I read about the ‚Äú24-hour post-vaccine flu‚Äù so much but going through it was a weird experience and I regret nothing!!

**Long version if anyone cares:**

‚Ä¢ First dose, I had a super sore arm, nothing else. Got my second shot midday Friday and fell asleep feeling great. 

‚Ä¢ Woke up 10 hours after my shot in a pool of sweat and discomfort. Really thought I could outsmart Pfizer by falling asleep on it. I forced myself out of bed to pee and almost stopped mid-stream to throw-up. Was at that level of discomfort and nauseousness where you just land on the bed and put little effort into anything beyond that. 

‚Ä¢ Woke up confused, sweaty, hot, cold, and feverish all at once. Had *super* vivid dreams. Also my head hurt in a very unique, shitty way. Popped an excederin and continued to sleep as much as possible. Any awake periods were confusing, sweaty, hot, cold and feverish. 

‚Ä¢ Night rolled around and I did the unspoken, drank NyQuil. I truly believe this vaccine no-no saved me and gave me a beautiful, healing slumber.

‚Ä¢ Day 2 Post-Pfizer: I woke up feeling brand new (still slightly sweaty). Felt amazing all day, honestly, I feel better than before‚Ä¶ like my body hit reset. Still unnecessarily sweaty tho.",2021-05-03 05:58:06

My 2nd vaccine (under similar circumstances of very few hours of sleep) took several hours for me to feel anything.

I struggled as to whether to take this or not.  Don't normally take a vaccination until it's been around a couple of years.  But, I'm in the high risk group for Covid.

From reading the comments, some people clearly get different responses, but are these not normal vaccine responses in that they are very common and it is a new vaccine.
I.e. it is a response rather than a side effect.

I‚Äôm 24 hours past my second vaccine. I didn‚Äôt have any noticeable reaction to my first one. I was pretty nervous for my second though and thus found myself on Reddit.

Just sort of how you feel the night before you wake up sick. Body aches and an almost sore throat. Took some Tylenol, melatonin, and some cannabis oil. Went to bed and woke up feeling fine. I‚Äôd recommend getting it in the morning so you can sleep through the worst of it.

I did sort of prep. By prep I mean I actually made sure I drank water and took the vitamins I normally take with a little extra vitamin D + C. Also ate a big bowl of pho (the magic cure all). My husband has his today at 10am. If anything is drastically different I‚Äôll update.

Also, move your arm around a ton. I know it looks dumb to do while you‚Äôre waiting but it helps a lot. My arm was sore but not nearly as sore as many of my friends were. I didn‚Äôt have a knot either.",2021-04-29 15:04:30

‚ÄúThis paper was published by an anti-vaccine activist who believes that the U.S. government may have created COVID-19 and preemptively vaccinated some people through the unrelated MMR vaccine.

Comment,6,gw6mfgt,,0,1619624676.0,"An anecdotal story for you- 

I was convinced I had dizziness and headaches every day for 21 days after my first shot.  (You can see it in my comment history).  After mentioning it to my friend, she sent me a couple screenshots of me complaining of the same thing in January when I became postpartum.   (I received my shot at the end of March).  I wasn‚Äôt planning to get my second because I was CONvINcEd it was all related.  My dr told me she thought I was dehydrated and did a CBC.  My red blood count and cholesterol was higher than usual (usually I‚Äôm perfectly within the optimal ranges.  But these results can be explained by dehydration).  I didn‚Äôt believe it was a hydration issue and kept feeling super anxious about it.  I forced her to redo my bloodwork a few days later and drank a ton of water mainly thinking I would shove it in her face when everything was still askew.  Well, everything was back to normal...

I wasn‚Äôt planning to get my second shot but then became a bit more anxious about being in limbo..I was especially anxious after reading all these Reddit posts... but then thought that I know about 60+ people in real life  who have been vaccinated since December with no consequence.  (Not to say there aren‚Äôt people with issues.  I‚Äôm just letting you know that it‚Äôs not always the case)

so I drank a lot of water and got my second shot... felt only arm soreness and a little fatigue that didn‚Äôt stop me from working remotely while taking care of two kids Under 3.... 

I guess my point it, maybe the ringing in your ears could be from clenching your jaw from feeling understandably anxious about getting the vaccine?? Anxiety is a bitch... I‚Äôve suffered from it in many forms and it actually gave me TMJ after my first child. TMJ + anxiety has really been hard for me the last 3 years!! 

Not saying this is the case, but try calming down and drinking a ton of water and if you start to feel a little better - awesome! If you don‚Äôt then keep working to find out the cause! Good luck!",2021-04-28 18:44:36

It moved from a stabbing, squeezing feeling in my chest to my ribs, back, neck and jaw.

Got the Pfizer first dose, immediately after my arm was weak, including my hands. Traveled up to my shoulder then went away about an hour later.

10 days later, that feeling came back in the middle of the night in my hands and wrists, as well as ankles. That feeling went away the next day. Came back that night, and Saturday was the worst. I felt just about every covid symptom they're is but the main issue bring the joint aches and weakness in the areas mentioned. This weakness/aches has been off and on ever since. Today is Tuesday and I was starting to feel better, energy back, arms finally feeling better until I stretched them and the weakness is back, arms hands and feet ankles.

2nd dose (4/27): headaches are now gone, dizziness is not. Had a sore arm, still brain fog 4 days later and generally feeling weird. I had body aches for like an hour, but they really sucked.

It only took 2 months, but that just goes to show how much knowledge is lacking now because they finally got their shit together.

VSAFE! Everyone needs to do this regardless if they told you about it at your appointment. It's not just my state but nation wide, all reports are finally going straight to the CDC and they're finally listening

Why has Covid cured the flu, heart attacks, and every malady known to man, but the vaccine, aka gene therapy doesn‚Äôt. 
They will tell you that flu disappeared because people stayed home and and wore masks. Think. If that were the case, Covid would have disappeared. I heard a physician say that Covid is just another flu. How many people die annually? If you check the stats, that number has not increased. Fear is a powerful tool.

Comment,1,gvspkqm,,0,1619336255.0,"Hey all so I ended up getting my 2nd dose April 5th... Felt totally fine and then 3am came around and it felt like I got hit with a ton of bricks. This time, like last, I didn't even feel the needle, but at 3am it felt like I just got shot in the arm, total muscle pain, severe joint pain from fingers to toes (which has not lessened whatsoever, omw to er now) also made my chronic back pain absolutely unbearable.. Had some slight nausea but not too bad, no headaches, but instead of hot flashes I got chills this time and insomnia again. Everything pretty much went away after a week except the severe joint and back pain, and the insomnia. Second dose was way more intense with everything hitting me at once literally out of the blue. First Dose took days to feel reactions and they came in over more time, not hitting me all at once...So everything but this incessant pain went away within a week. Much better than the first dose but still terrible because I've never in my life had joint pain nor has my back pain been so bad, I've actually got surgery scheduled for it in two weeks. And the insomnia this time is absolutely due to the pain, unlike the first dose which acted like a stimulant incapable of keeping my eyes closed. 

Again, first dose effects were more in quantity and length overall, second dose less reactions over much shorter time, except this intense pain and inability to sleep. 

Didn't experience this joint pain at all the first time, so I'm hoping this does not last a long time but the pain level has not gotten any better just worse. 

Still, glad I got them both because a friend of mine,who could have gotten his first vaccine last month just HAD to wait for 4/20 and ended up contracting covid either before or right after his first dose. He's in denial but when he said he couldn't smell of taste anything the past two days I knew that was no reaction. 

PLEASE everyone sign up for VSAFE, don't be selfish and care only for yourself, this was the problem the first time I got the vaccine, VAERS is a joke. Pisses me off VSAFE wasn't around when they started giving vaccines. Only my wife out of my entire family was even told to sign up for it at the vac site, everyone else I know was vaccinated at the same site too. It's like a different agency is in charge in my County every time they vaccinate. 

So please, search cdc website or Google VSAFE and sign up. Super simple takes a couple minutes and they send you a text once a day asking how and what you feel of are experiencing! Takes less than a minute to do. So please please please sign up!",2021-04-25 10:37:35

Comment,1,gvnlfn9,,0,1619244941.0,"You know what all of the people arguing that these vaccines are safe and tested and blah blah blah DON'T know because they haven't RESEARCHED anything ANYTHING about the previous mRNA vaccines developed for Sars/CoV and Mers back in 2010/ 2011. If they did they would see that ALL of those vaccine candidates FAILED due to a host of horrific side effects that only showed up AFTER they were introduced to the virus as a means of testing the effectiveness of the vaccine. Those that made it that far were the lucky ones as the vaccine killed ALL the ferrets. Now, here's the real kicker....there have been NO CHANGES to the mRNA vaccines being pushed on us, none. So before you call anyone a conspiracy theorist or whatever for not taking the vaccine do research on vaccines made for Corona viruses like the common cold or the original Sars/Mers viruses..

I sleep 12 hours a night, every night.

I've managed only 1 run since the jab, and it was less than 2 miles. Normally I run 3 - 4 miles, 4 times a week. I also normally do ~3 hours of strength training every week. So far I've only managed 1 15-minute session.

After each of these mini-workouts, I was so tired that I was totally bedridden the next day.

I have a mountain of laundry to do, my floors need vacuuming, and I can't do any of it because I'm so goddamn tired all the time.

Yesterday I went shopping at CVS for about 45 minutes. It's only 6 blocks from my house. I took a 2-hour nap when I got home.

I'm just glad I'm still unemployed, because I can't imagine trying to explain to a boss that I can't come in to work for weeks on end because I'm ""tired.""

I'm now terrified of getting the second shot, since the side effects are supposed to be worse after the second dose. I'm worried that I'm going to waste the whole summer in bed.

I've done endless Google searches on this topic, but can find nothing. Everything I've read says that the side effects should be gone in a few days. Nobody seems to believe me when I tell them I'm still feeling like shit every day.

ETA: Started feeling better a few days after I posted this comment. Got my second Pfizer shot on 5/1/21. Pain/swelling at injection site was much worse than with the 1st shot, but only lasted 36 - 48 hours. I also experienced fatigue and nausea, just like last time, but the symptoms were maybe like 10% of the hell I experienced after the 1st shot. 

Other commenters here said that if your 1st shot symptoms are really bad, your 2nd shot symptoms are likely to be mild. I have no idea if that's really true overall, but it was certainly true for me. My arm hurt a lot, and I was kinda tired/nauseous for the first couple days, but it went away very quickly compared to last time, and I feel 100% now (""now"" meaning the evening of 5/7/21).",2021-04-23 23:58:58

I had chest tightness and had to use my nebulizer (I have asthma) and inhaler a couple of times. I just stayed a calm and still as I could for a few days and by the next week it was over. After the second shot I had a pain between my shoulders, then in my chest, sternum area. I put if off for a few days until the pain woke me up then I went to the ER just to check if a blood clot.

Comment,1,gvk28p6,,0,1619179307.0,"I have problems after 2nd dose Pfizer(which was two weeks ago). In the beginning not so bad, arm pain and fatigue.

Then after a week every day feeling like getting a cold, a little sore throat, some coughing, I can feel my bronchi seizing up, some feeling flu-like. No runny nose, not getting worse. And the crazy thing is, it starts EVERY DAY at the same time!!! The time of vaccination, ablout 1-2 o'clock. Next morning everything ok, then it starts again.

I read this somewhere that somebody said that, cannot find it again It sounds absolutely crazy, doesn't it? Is there any explanation for that?

I am so happy about the vaccination, so it's not psychological. And I do know my body is rather wrecked, am 61, had cancer 3 times, chemo, radiation therapy twice, plus several autoimmune illnesses. So I do not wonder about the reaction itsself, it is the timing each day which is funny.",2021-04-23 15:01:47

Comment,2,gvhnfnp,,0,1619124933.0,"It seems like there's no one size fits all vaccine reaction.  Seems like MOST people have a stronger reaction to second shot.  MOST people have fever, chills, arm soreness that goes away in about 24 hours.

I am a 53 yo F VERY healthy, don't take any prescription meds. Very RARELY sick and never miss work due to illness.

Shot 1: March 13- absolutely nothing but a sore arm. 

Shot 2: April 4 at 11:00 am.  Didn't feel anything this day (did have trouble sleeping that night). Went to work the next day and started to have chills around 4:00 (so almost 30 hours after shot). Got home and had 100.6 fever and chills. My unusual side effect was that I had gastro issues- I had such bad gas (I know this sounds funny, but it was AWFUL). By the next day it turned into diarrhea. The diarrhea was never severe-I was able to make it to work, kept drinking lots of extra fluids. It took a few more days and then I experienced soreness in my hips and back of thighs along with some joint pain.  It all seemed to be a delayed reaction to me.  My gastro issues continued on for almost 2 weeks, slowly getting better. I'm now 18 days out and my bowels are finally ALMOST back to normal.   It has caused me SO MUCH anxiety because none of it seemed to fit into the ""typical"" side effects, and it lingered for a long time.  I did learn that of all 3 vaccines, pfizer is the only one that has diarrhea as a side effect.
